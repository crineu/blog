![Don't Panic!](../images/dontpanic.jpg)

> If a writer wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.

Victor **Hugo**

> It does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of man’s proper stature – and that the rest will betray it. **It is those few that move the world** and give life its meaning – and it is those few that I have always sought to address. The rest are no concern of mine; it is not me [...] that they will betray: it is their own souls.

Ayn **Rand**, New York – May 1968
