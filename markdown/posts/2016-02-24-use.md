> What is the difference between a **duke**, an **earl**, a **lord**, a **marquis**, a **baron** and a **count**?

“__D__o __M__en __E__ver __V__isit __B__oston?”

###### Duke > Marquis > Earl > Viscount > Baron.

### Duke

The highest, most powerful rank. There are but a handful of **dukes**.  William the Conqueror was a duke.

### Marquis

Some counties are border counties. A border county is where the action is. **Counts** and **Earls** are equivalent ranks – wives of earls have always been called countesses.

> What is a **count**?  He is the ruler of a county.

So, eventually, border count became a rank above regular count. Thus: **marquis**.

### Viscount

Is below **count**, the same as the vice president is below the president.

### Baron

Is the bottom of the totem pole. But these are all **barons**, to hear some people tell it. When the **king** is at odds with his **barons**, and they're making him sign the Magna Carta, you can bet that the **dukes**, **marqueses**, **earls**, **counts**, and **viscounts** are standing with the **barons**, not with the **king**.

> But, to hear some tell it, a **baron** is anybody who holds directly from the **king**. So the **dukes and such are literally barons**.  They just don't call themselves that because they have more impressive titles.

    Expect all of this to be wrong: things can switch up on you every time you cross into a new country or a new century.
