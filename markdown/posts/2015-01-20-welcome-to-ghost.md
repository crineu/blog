You're live! Nice.

For you.

Let's get this thing started, shall we?

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.

> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }
    

### Ready for a Break?

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
