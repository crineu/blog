## Laws

Universal laws, pretty much held true across all of human society:

1. **Nostalgia** is the most powerful force in the universe;
2. You want to persuade people, you need to **know your audience**;
3. **It is not good to be food**. Human beings do not like the idea of becoming food for other creatures. It is a source of revulsion to us;
4. Usually making leadership decisions means **choosing between two bad things**;
5. When you tell a lie, you should tell **a lie that is close to the truth**;
6. **Secrecy creates intimacy** – proprietary knowledge makes people closer to each other;
7. A **deep connection to the land is a common human expression**. The idea that this land just kind of came to you, and it belongs to you in some sense. The idea of being dislocated and wandering, such as Odysseus embraces, is a little bit disconcerting, and to think that you have an actual rooted connection to a land is a nice thing to have;
8. People at the top and people at the bottom of the power structure **tend to embrace teleology** (the idea that history is moving toward some predetermined end point).

## Hesiod’s cosmology:

**Chasm** (Caos, emptyness), **Earth** (Gaia, Gaea), **Eros** (violent sexual desire) and **Tartara** (pluralized Tartarus) were allways there.

**Earth** and **Sky** (Heaven, Uranus) generates **Kronos**. Earth asks and Kronos cuts Sky’s genitals and hurls them to the sea. From a foam of these genitals, **Athenas** is born (this is the *alpha* stage of creation).

**Kronos** (Cronos, Saturn) and **Rhead** (Ground) begin *beta* stage of creation. Kronos starts swallowing all his childs (Hestia, Hear, Demeter, Hades and Poseidon), except the youngest one, **Zeus**. **Rhea** gives him a stone instead.

**Zeus** grows and overthrows **Kronos**, who vomit his childs. The stone regurgitaded is **Omphalos**, center of universe, oracle site of Delphi.

**Zeus** divides the Universe between himself (sky), **Poseidon** (sea), and **Hades** (underworld).

Zeus conceives the Olympians **Apollo** & **Artemis** (twins), **Ares**, and **Athena**.

## Some remarks

Sneezing as a sign of a truth

> Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of Odysseus. His waiting wife **Penelope**, hearing Odysseus may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son **Telemachus** sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, **reassured that it is a sign from the gods**.

Teiresias special power

> In Ovid’s epic, Teiresias is especially noteworthy because he had sex as both a man and a woman.

Odysseus being Odysseus

> In the dispute for Achilles’ arms, **Ajax** was a better warrior than **Ulysses**, but not a better speaker.

## Toolbox

### Functionalism

**Bronisaw Malinowski**

> When cultures tell myths to themselves, what they’re doing is **legitimizing certain kinds of underlying social and cultural norms** that they hold dear.
> 
> So myths are myths because they serve a certain kind of function, and the function they serve is that **they legitimize**.

> Origin is not important when it comes to functionalism.

### Structuralism

**Claude Levi-Strauss**

> **Myth reflects human mind** => binary representations of everything.
> 
> Which part of the narrative reflect one theme and which part reflect the oposite theme - the order doesn’t matter.

> Find the two biological opositions (food / not food). These binary pairs do not reconciliate.

### Psycho-analysis

**Sigmund Freud**

> **Myths are the dream of an entire culture.** Myths dramatize events in every indiviual’s mental or psycological development.

> Why in the world a culture would like to tell itself a myth like this?

### Myth and ritual

**Émile Durkheim & Jane Harisson**

> Collective effervescence: when human groups, amazing things happen. When we see connections between myths and rituals: that’s how they work.

> Ritual present strange behavior, and when someone tries to explain them, they invent stories, and **these stories are what we call myth**.
