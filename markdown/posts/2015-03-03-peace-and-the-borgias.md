> In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had *warfare*, *terror*, *murder*, *bloodshed*, but they produced *Michelangelo*, Leonardo *da Vinci* and **the Renaissance**.

> In Switzerland, they had *brotherly love* â€“ they had five hundred years of *democracy* and *peace*, and what did that produce? The **cuckoo clock**.
