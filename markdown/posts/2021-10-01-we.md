To judge by the descriptions that reach us from the ancients, they felt somewhat like this during their “church services.” 

But they served their **nonsensical, unknown god**; we serve our **rational god**, whom we know most thoroughly.

Their god gave them **nothing but eternal, torturing seeking**; our god gives us **absolute truth** – that is, he has rid us of any kind of doubt.

> Their god did not invent anything cleverer than sacrificing oneself, nobody knows what for; we bring to our god, the United State, a quiet, rational, carefully thought-out sacrifice.

-- We, from Zamyatin Yevgeny
