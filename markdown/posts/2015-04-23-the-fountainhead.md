    The Fountainhead (Ayn Rand, 1943)

![The Fountainhead](../images/fountainhead.jpg)

### At the new job

He had learned to accept his new job. The lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel beams, and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry. It was difficult, at times. Between him and the plan of the building on which he was working stood the plan of that building as it should have been. He saw what he could make of it, how to change the lines he drew, where to lead them in order to achieve a thing of splendor. **He had to choke the knowledge. He had to kill the vision. He had to obey […] as instructed. It hurt him so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger**.

**But the pain remained--and a helpless wonder**. The thing he saw was so much more real than the reality of paper, office and commission. **He could not understand what made others blind to it**, and what made their indifference possible. [...] **He wondered why ineptitude should exist and have its say**. He had never known that. And the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him.

### An expert speaks about architecture...

And thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact that we deal in nothing. We create emptiness through which certain physical bodies are to move – we shall designate them for convenience as humans. By emptiness I mean what is commonly known as rooms. Thus it is only the crass layman who thinks that we put up stone walls. We do nothing of the kind. We put up emptiness, **as I have proved**. This leads us to a corollary of astronomical importance: to the **unconditional acceptance of the premise that ‘absence’ is superior to ‘presence’. That is, to the acceptance of non-acceptance**. I shall state this in simpler terms – for the sake of clarity: **’nothing’ is superior to ‘something’**. Thus it is clear that the architect is more than a bricklayer – since the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion anyway. The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to face the primal conception of reality as nonreality – since there is nothing and he creates nothingness. If this sounds like a contradiction, **it is not a proof of bad logic, but of a higher logic**, the dialectics of all life and art. Should you wish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic conception, **you may come to conclusions of vast sociological importance. You may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to a non-beautiful one, that the literate is inferior to the illiterate, that the rich is inferior to the poor, and the able to the incompetent**. The architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox. Let us be modest in the vast pride of this realization. Everything else is twaddle.

#### ...and the result is:

The Council of American Builders met once a month and *engaged in no tangible activity*, beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer. Its membership did not grow fast either in quantity or in quality. *There were no concrete results achieved.*

### A dead issue

It will prove nothing, whether he wins or loses. […] All of it will be forgotten before Christmas.

Right, my dear, everything will be forgotten by next Christmas. And that, you see, will be the achievement. **You can fight a live issue. You can’t fight a dead one.** Dead issues, like all dead things, don’t just vanish, but leave some decomposing matter behind. A most unpleasant thing to carry on your name. Mr. H will be thoroughly forgotten. The Temple will be forgotten. The lawsuit will be forgotten. But here’s what will remain: ‘Howard Roark? Why, how could you trust a man like that? He’s an enemy of religion. He’s completely immortal. First thing you know, he’ll gyp you on your construction costs.’ ‘Roark? He’s no good – why, a client had to sue him because he made such a botch of a building.’ ‘Roark? Wait a moment, isn’t that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of a mess? Now what was it? Some rotten kind of scandal, the owner of the building […] had to sue him. You don’t want to get involved with a notorious character like that.’

**Fight that, my dear. Tell me a way to fight it.**

Now you see the peculiar effectiveness of a dead issue. You can’t talk your way out of it, you can’t explain, you can’t defend yourself. Nobody wants to listen. It is difficult enough to acquire fame. **It is impossible to change its nature once you’ve acquired it.** No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that he’s a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he’s an atheist, or because somebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls wings off bottleflies. **You’ll say it doesn’t make sense? Of course it doesn’t. That’s why it works. Reason can be fought with reason. How are you going to fight the unreasonable?**

### What do you think of me?

— Mr. Roark, we’re alone here. Why don’t you tell me what you think of me?

> But I don’t think of you.

### A hater of mankind

— I never have any definite destination. This ship is not for going to places, but for getting away from them. When I stop at a port, it’s only for the sheer pleasure of leaving it. I always think: Here’s one more spot that can’t hold me.

— I always felt just like that. I’ve been told it’s because I’m a hater of mankind.

— Surely you’ve seen through that particular stupidity. I mean the one that claims the creature that accepts anything is the symbol of love for humanity. As a matter of fact, **the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity can outrage him.**

— You mean the person who says that there’s some good in the worst of us?

— I mean the person who has the filthy insolence to claim that he loves equally the man who made that statue of you and the man who makes a Mickey Mouse balloon to sell on street corners. I mean the person who loves the men who prefer the Mickey Mouse to your statue – and there are many of that kind. […] I mean the person who loves the clean, steady, unfrightened eyes of man looking through a telescope and the white stare of an imbecile equally. […] **One can’t love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. It’s one or the other.**

— What will you say if I give you the answer people usually give me – that love is forgiveness? Or that love is pity?

— […] love is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don’t know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who’ve never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you’ve felt what it means to love as you and I know it you’re incapable of anything less.

— As – you and I – know it?

— It’s what we feel when we look at a thing like your statue. There’s no forgiveness in that, and no pity. And I’d want to kill the man who claims that there should be. **But, you see, when he looks at your statue – he feels nothing. That – or a dog with a broken paw – it’s all the same to him. He even feels that he’s done something nobler by bandaging the dog’s paw than by looking at your statue.** So if you seek a glimpse of greatness, if you want exaltation, if you ask for God and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute – you’re called a hater of humanity because you’ve committed the crime of knowing a love humanity has not learned to deserve.

### Let them come to New York

— You’ve never felt how small you were when looking at the ocean.

— Never. Nor looking at the planets. Nor at mountain peaks. Nor at the Grand Canyon. Why should I? When I look at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I think of man’s magnificent capacity that created this ship to conquer all that senseless space. **When I look at mountain peaks, I think of tunnels and dynamite.** When I look at the planets, I think of airplanes.

— Yes. And that particular sense of sacred rapture men say they experience in contemplating nature – I’ve never received it from nature, only from buildings... Skyscrapers.

— **I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York’s skyline.** Particularly when one can’t see the details. Just the shapes. The shapes and the thought that made them. The sky over New York and the will of man made visible. **What other religion do we need? And then people tell me about pilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a crumbling temple, to a leering stone monster with a pot belly, created by some leprous savage.** Is it beauty and genius they want to see? Do they seek a sense of the sublime?

**Let them come to New York, stand on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel.**

It’s interesting to speculate on the reasons that make men so anxious to debase themselves. As in that idea of feeling small before nature. It’s not a bromide, it’s practically an institution. Have you noticed how self-righteous a man sounds when he tells you about it? Look, he seems to say, I’m so glad to be a pygmy, that’s how virtuous I am. […] **But that’s not the spirit that leashed fire, steam, electricity, that crossed oceans in sailing sloops, that built airplanes and dams...and skyscrapers. What is it they fear? What is they hate so much, those who love to crawl? And why?**

### The only thing I hate

— Did you want to scream, when you were a child, seeing nothing but fat ineptitude around you, knowing how many things could be done and done so well, but having no power to do them? Having no power to blast the empty skulls around you? Having to take orders – and that’s bad enough – but to take orders from your inferiors! Have you felt that?

— Yes.

— Did you drive the anger back inside of you, and store it, and decide to let yourself be torn to pieces if necessary, but reach the day when you’d rule those people and all people and everything around you?

— No.

— You didn’t? You let yourself forget?

— No. **I hate incompetence.** I think it’s probably the only thing I do hate. But it didn’t make me want to rule people. Nor to teach them anything. It made me want to do my own work in my own way and let myself be torn to pieces if necessary.

— And you were?

— No. Not in any way that counts.

### Selling your soul

— If you offer me enough.

— Anything you ask. Anything. I’d sell my soul...

— That’s the sort of thing I want you to understand. **To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That’s what everybody does every hour of his life.** If I asked you to keep your soul – would you understand why that’s much harder?

But first, I want you to think and tell me what made me give years to this work. Money? Fame? Charity? Altruism? He shook his head slowly – All right. You’re beginning to understand. **So whatever we do, don’t let’s talk about the poor people in the slums. They have nothing to do with it, though I wouldn’t envy anyone the job of trying to explain that to fools.** You see, I’m never concerned with my clients, only with their architectural requirements. I consider these as part of my building’s theme and problem, as my building’s material – just as I consider bricks and steel. Bricks and steel are not my motive. Neither are the clients. Both are only the means of my work. **Before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done.** But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I’ll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that’s not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.

You said yesterday: What architect isn’t interested in housing? I hate the whole blasted idea of it. I think it’s a worthy undertaking – to provide a decent apartment for a man who earns fifteen dollars a week. But not at the expense of other men. Not if it raises the taxes, raises all the other rents and makes the man who earns forty live in a rat hole. That’s what’s happening. **Nobody can afford a modern apartment – except the very rich and the paupers.** Have you seen the converted brownstones in which the average self-supporting couple has to live? Have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing? **They’re forced to live like that – because they’re not incompetent enough.** They make forty dollars a week and wouldn’t be allowed into a housing project. **But they’re the ones who provide the money for the damn project.** They pay the taxes. And the taxes raise their own rent. And they have to move from a converted brownstone into an unconverted one and from that into a railroad flat.

**I’d have no desire to penalize a man because he’s worth only fifteen dollars a week. But I’ll be damned if I can see why a man worth forty must be penalized – and penalized in favor of the one who’s less competent.** Sure, there are a lot of theories on the subject and volumes of discussion. But just look at the results.

### Conceited

— Why, no. I’m too conceited. If you want to call it that. I don’t make comparisons. I never think of myself in relation to anyone else. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything. I’m an utter egotist.

— Yes. You are. But egotists are not kind. And you are. You’re the most egotistical and the kindest man I know. And that doesn’t make sense.

**— Maybe the concepts don’t make sense. Maybe they don’t mean what people have been taught to think they mean.**

### A trend embraced gradually

— That’s what I want to know – what the hell? He picked up the proof and read aloud:

> The world we have known is gone and done for and it’s no use kidding ourselves about it. **We cannot go back, we must go forward.** The mothers of today must set the example by broadening their own emotional view and raising their selfish love for their own children to a higher plane, to include everybody’s little children. Mothers must love every kid in their block, in their street, in their city, county, state, nation and the whole wide, wide world – just exactly as much as their own little Mary or Johnny.

**It’s all right to dish out crap. But – this kind of crap?**

He had known for several years the trend which his paper had embraced gradually, imperceptibly, without any directive from him. He had noticed the cautious slanting of news stories, the *half-hints*, the *vague allusions*, the *peculiar adjectives peculiarly placed*, the *stressing of certain themes*, the **insertion of political conclusions where none was needed**. If a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee, the employer was made to appear guilty, simply through wording, no matter what the facts presented. If a sentence referred to the past, it was always **our dark past** or our **dead past**. If a statement involved someone’s personal motive, it was always *goaded by selfishness* or *egged by greed.* A crossword puzzle gave the definition of obsolescent individuals and the word came out as *capitalists*.

### Second Handers

— The thing that is destroying the world. The thing you were talking about. Actual selflessness.

— The ideal which they say does not exist?

— They’re wrong. It does exist – though not in the way they imagine. **It’s what I couldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live within others. They live second-hand.** Look at poor Peter. He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness – in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy – all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.

— **That’s the pattern most people follow.**

— Yes! And isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. The men who place money first – what they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to entertain, to impress others. They’re second-handers. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. **A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him – and the people who listen and don’t give a damn, but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name.** All second-handers.

— Aren’t you making out a case against selfishness? Aren’t they all acting on a selfish motive – to be noticed, liked, admired?

— By others. At the price of their own self-respect. In the realm of greatest importance – the realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought – they place others above self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. **A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn’t need it.**

— I think Toohey understands that. That’s what helps him spread his vicious nonsense. Just weakness and cowardice. **It’s so easy to run to others. It’s so hard to stand on one’s own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can’t fake it in your own eyes.** Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from it. They spend their lives running. It’s easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement. It’s simple to seek substitutes for competence – such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.

— That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people. They don’t ask: *’Is this true?’* They ask: *’Is this what others think is true?’* Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. **What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists.** You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work through another’s hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation – anchored to nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand in people. That’s what stopped me whenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and you can’t reason with him. He’s not open to reason. You can’t speak to him – he can’t hear. You’re tried by an empty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose.

— I think your second-handers understand this, try as they might not to admit it to themselves. Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognize him at once. By instinct. There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. **They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet.** The independent man kills them – because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existence they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man.

— That’s because some sense of dignity always remains in them. They’re still human beings. But they’ve been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man can achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no self-esteem in any form. He wouldn’t survive. **So after centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted.** By seeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world perishing from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander’s delusion – prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can’t say about a single thing: *‘This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.*’ Then he wonders why he’s unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. **The things which are sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing.** To seek joy in meeting halls. We haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean – for the self-sufficiency of man’s spirit. It’s difficult to call it selfishness or egotism, the words have been perverted. **I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men.** I’ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at once – and it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.

### Level of depravity

But we don’t wait to discover his reasons. We have convicted him without a hearing. We want him to be guilty. We are delighted with this case. What you hear is not indignation – it’s gloating. Any illiterate maniac, any worthless moron who commits some revolting murder, gets shrieks of sympathy from us and marshals an army of humanitarian defenders. But a man of genius is guilty by definition. **Granted that it is vicious injustice to condemn a man simply because he is weak and small. To what level of depravity has a society descended when it condemns a man simply because he is strong and great?**

### Self-sacrifice

We have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it. We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let’s stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man’s supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? **But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all.**
