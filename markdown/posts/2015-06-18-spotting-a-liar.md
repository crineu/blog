How to be better at conversations:

- 
One of the tricks to catch someone telling a lie is to see if they **repeatedly look to their left while talking** to you or **do not make any eye contact**.

- 
if you can get into the habit of not only remembering someone’s name when you first meet them, but **using their name in the subsequent conversation** you have, they’ll find you terribly charming and wonderful.

- 
To appear more confident, self-assured, thoughtful and knowledgeable - avoid using many filler words like ‘*uh*’, ‘*umm*’, ‘*err*’ etc. Instead, **use the silence (not too long) to order your thoughts** and more coherently communicate whatever it is you are trying to get across.

- 
People perceive other people with **better posture** as more important and confident people.

- 
During negotiations, **use silence as a weapon**. Most people are uncomfortable with it an they will try to break it by giving up a key point.

- 
If you ask someone a question and they only partially answer, give them a few seconds. By **remaining silent and keeping your eye contact**, they will usually continue talking.
