### 1. Find a personal angle

- What do you want to learn from this book?
- How might it change you life for the better?
- What kind of people should read it in general, and why are you one of them?

### 2. Get a bird’s eye view in 20 min

- what the book is about and
- the main takeaway

### 3. Drum up curiosity

Before you begin to read, craft a few good curiosity gap questions. Check out the back of the book or a few reviews online for help: this content is made to get you interested in the book, so it’ll lead you in the right direction.

### 4. Flip through the book and create your own structure

- Identify the key points,

- separate them into
- elemental chunks and
- write them down,

- making sure to leave plenty of

- space between each for your own notes (ghost).

### 5. Record key insights

**In your own words**, make brief notes about your main takeaways from the reading and find the best place for these insights in the structure you’ve crafted. You’ll end up with a summary of the book in your own words, made in a way your brain best understands.

### 6. Review your notes within

- 10 minutes of learning it,
- then again 48 hours later,
- and again in 7 days.

Thanks to step five, you’re already armed with your **own personally relevant summary**. Read it for 10 minutes after you finish the book, then again three days later, and keep resurrecting it for up to a month. As you review the summary, try to remember other details related to the messages you’ve recorded.

With each repetition, you’ll be blazing that trail ever more certainly into the geography of your brain.
