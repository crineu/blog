> Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows:

> You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. **You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues**. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward — reversing cause and effect. I call these the “*wet streets cause rain*” stories.

> Paper’s full of them.

> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read **as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read**.

> You turn the page, and forget what you know.
