<h3>“It is quite natural that the sexual and feminist revolutions have made woman unhappy.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feminism separates women from the family</strong>, and so from a social institution that gives them an absolutely central place in the world they inhabit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It also weakens the Family as such</strong>. Looser sex roles and sexual standards mean less mutual responsibility between the sexes and suppression of the masculine ideal, including concepts of protection and honor. <strong>The natural results are men women cannot rely on, children without fathers, and feminized poverty.</strong></p>
<h3>Why should women want that?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What they mostly want is marriage that works, support when they are bearing and raising children, and a favorable environment for those children to grow into.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have been deprived of those things, but are supposedly compensated for the loss by the right to support themselves and their children by accepting subordinate positions in commercial organizations that view them as disposable profit centers.</p>
<p>To help them do so, progressives give them the right to abortion and free contraception, the right to have other people raise their children for them, and the welfare state to fall back on, when additional help is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the resulting situation better and more dignified than a position as wife, mother and homemaker?”</strong></p>
