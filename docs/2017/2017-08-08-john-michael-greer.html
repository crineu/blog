      <blockquote>
<p>I’d been in the middle of the groupthink that made progress look like the only option even when progress was half a century into negative returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everyone I knew was well aware that “newer” had stopped meaning “better” a long time ago</strong>, that every upgrade meant more problems and fewer benefits, that the latest must-have technologies did less and cost more than the last round, but nobody seemed to be able to draw the obvious conclusion**.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Retrotopia</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always gotten” – and I wonder how many of the people who spend each year daydreaming about the <strong>energy breakthroughs</strong>, <strong>changes in consciousness</strong>, <strong>economic collapses</strong>, et al, rather than coming to grips with the <strong>rising spiral of crises facing industrial civilization</strong>, really want to deal with the future that they’re storing up for themselves by indulging in this habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– A Leap in the Dark</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>That sequence also turned into a book, Decline and Fall. In the posts and the book, I pointed out that one of the constants of the history of democratic societies – actual democracies, warts and all, as distinct from the imaginary “real democracy” that exists solely in rhetoric – is a regular cycle of concentration and diffusion of power. The ancient Greek historian Polybius, who worked it out in detail, called it <em>anacyclosis</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside the brief interval of enforced peace following the Second World War, Europe has been a boiling cauldron of warfare since its modern cultures began to emerge out of the chaos of the post–Roman dark ages. Most of the world’s most devastating wars have been European in origin, and of course it escapes no one’s attention in the rest of the world that it was from Europe that hordes of invaders and colonizers swept over the entire planet from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, as often as not leaving total devastation in their wake. <strong>In histories written a thousand years from now, Europeans will have the same sort of reputation that Huns and Mongols have today</strong> – and it’s only in the fond fantasies of those who think history has a direction that those days are definitely over.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the era of US global hegemony, the five per cent of our species who lived in the United States disposed of a third of the world’s raw materials and manufactured products and a quarter of its total energy production. That disproportionate share came to us via unbalanced patterns of exchange hardwired into the global economy, and enforced at gunpoint by the military garrisons we keep in more than a hundred countries worldwide. <strong>The ballooning US government, corporate, and consumer debt load of recent years was an attempt to keep those imbalances in place even as their basis in geopolitics trickled away. Now the dance is ending and the piper has to be paid.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>– How Great the Fall Can Be</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, the fact that free trade is bad policy doesn’t mean that every kind of trade barrier is good policy. The habit of insisting that the only possible points along a spectrum are its two ends, common as it is, is an effective way to make really bad decisions; as in most things, there’s a middle ground that yields better results than either of the two extremes. Finding that middle ground isn’t necessarily easy, but the same thing’s true of most economic and political issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thus free trade causes the impoverishment and immiseration of the labor force, and a cascading series of economic busts driven by the mismatch between insufficent consumption and excess investment.</strong> Those problems aren’t accidental – they’re hardwired into any free trade system – and the only way to stop them in their tracks <strong>is to abandon free trade as bad policy, and replace it with sensible trade barriers that ensure that most of the products consumed in each nation are made there</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– The Free Trade Fallacy</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Around the time that this effort finally petered out into absurdity, it was replaced by the core concept of the identity politics currently central to the American left: <strong>the conviction that the only divisions in American society that matter are those that have some basis in biology</strong>. Skin color, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability – these are the divisions that the American left likes to talk about these days, to the exclusion of all other social divisions, and especially to the exclusion of social class. Since the left has dominated public discourse in the United States for many decades now, those have become the divisions that the American right talks about, too.</p>
