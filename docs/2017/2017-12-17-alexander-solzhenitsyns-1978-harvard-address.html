      <p>In today’s Western society the inequality has been revealed [in] freedom for good deeds and freedom for evil deeds. A statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has to move cautiously and even timidly. There are thousands of hasty and irresponsible critics around him; parliament and the press keep rebuffing him. As he moves ahead, he has to prove that each single step of his is well-founded and absolutely flawless. Actually, <strong>an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself</strong>. From the very beginning, dozens of traps will be set out for him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, <strong>mediocrity triumphs</strong> with the excuse of restrictions <strong>imposed by democracy</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>It is feasible and easy everywhere to undermine administrative power and in fact it has been drastically weakened in all Western countries. <strong>The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s time, in the West — It is time, in the West, <strong>to defend not so much human rights as human obligations</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic disease of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press. Such as it is, however, the press has become the greatest power within the Western countries, more powerful than the legislative power, the executive, and the judiciary. And one would then like to ask: By what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible? In the communist East a journalist is frankly appointed as a state official. <strong>But who has granted Western journalists their power, for how long a time, and with what prerogatives?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>However, the most cruel mistake occurred with the failure to understand the Vietnam war. Some people sincerely wanted all wars to stop just as soon as possible; others believed that there should be room for national, or communist, self-determination in Vietnam, or in Cambodia, as we see today with particular clarity. But members of the U.S. anti-war movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. <strong>Do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there? Do they understand their responsibility today? Or do they prefer not to hear?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The turn introduced by the Renaissance evidently was inevitable historically. The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion, becoming an intolerable despotic repression of man’s physical nature in favor of the spiritual one. Then, however, we turned our backs upon the Spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal. This new way of thinking, which had imposed on us its guidance, did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth. <strong>It based modern Western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs.</strong> Everything beyond physical well-being and accumulation of material goods, all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature, were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems, as if human life did not have any superior sense. That provided access for evil, of which in our days there is a free and constant flow. <strong>Merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones.</strong></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The West ended up by truly enforcing <strong>human rights</strong>, sometimes even excessively, but man’s sense of responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past decades, the legalistically selfish aspect of Western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse. <strong>All the glorified technological achievements of Progress, including the conquest of outer space, do not redeem the 20th century’s moral poverty</strong> which no one could imagine even as late as in the 19th Century.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>To such consciousness, <strong>man is the touchstone in judging everything on earth</strong> — imperfect man, who is never free of pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other defects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility.</p>
<p>We have placed <strong>too much hope in political and social reforms</strong>, only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life. In the East, <strong>it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party</strong>. In the West, <strong>commercial interests suffocate it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This is the real crisis.</strong></p>
