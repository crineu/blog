<p>You’re live! Nice.</p>
<p>For you.</p>
<p>Let’s get this thing started, shall we?</p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That’s ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<p>fascinating</p>
<h3>Quoting</h3>
<p>Sometimes a link isn’t enough, you want to quote someone on what they’ve said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it’s definitely a word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wisdomous - it’s definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Working with Code</h3>
<p>Got a streak of geek? We’ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>
<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Ready for a Break?</h3>
<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you’ve got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>There’s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it’ll still work! Very flexible.</p>
<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
