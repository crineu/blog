<p>How to be better at conversations:</p>

</ul>
<p>One of the tricks to catch someone telling a lie is to see if they <strong>repeatedly look to their left while talking</strong> to you or <strong>do not make any eye contact</strong>.</p>

<li></li>
</ul>
<p>if you can get into the habit of not only remembering someone’s name when you first meet them, but <strong>using their name in the subsequent conversation</strong> you have, they’ll find you terribly charming and wonderful.</p>

</ul>
<p>To appear more confident, self-assured, thoughtful and knowledgeable - avoid using many filler words like ‘<em>uh</em>’, ‘<em>umm</em>’, ‘<em>err</em>’ etc. Instead, <strong>use the silence (not too long) to order your thoughts</strong> and more coherently communicate whatever it is you are trying to get across.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>People perceive other people with <strong>better posture</strong> as more important and confident people.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>During negotiations, <strong>use silence as a weapon</strong>. Most people are uncomfortable with it an they will try to break it by giving up a key point.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask someone a question and they only partially answer, give them a few seconds. By <strong>remaining silent and keeping your eye contact</strong>, they will usually continue talking.</p>
