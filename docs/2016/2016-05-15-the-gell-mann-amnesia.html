<h2>The Gell-Mann Amnesia</h2>
<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. <strong>You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues</strong>. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward — reversing cause and effect. I call these the “<em>wet streets cause rain</em>” stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paper’s full of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read <strong>as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You turn the page, and forget what you know.</p>
