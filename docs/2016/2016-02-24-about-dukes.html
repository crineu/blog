      <blockquote>
<p>What is the difference between a <strong>duke</strong>, an <strong>earl</strong>, a <strong>lord</strong>, a <strong>marquis</strong>, a <strong>baron</strong> and a <strong>count</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>D</strong>o <strong>M</strong>en <strong>E</strong>ver <strong>V</strong>isit <strong>B</strong>oston?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Duke &gt; Marquis &gt; Earl &gt; Viscount &gt; Baron.</h4>
<p><img src="../images/count.jpg" alt="Count" /></p>
<h3>Duke</h3>
<p>The highest, most powerful rank. There are but a handful of <strong>dukes</strong>.  William the Conqueror was a duke.</p>
<h3>Marquis</h3>
<p>Some counties are border counties. A border county is where the action is. <strong>Counts</strong> and <strong>Earls</strong> are equivalent ranks – wives of earls have always been called countesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a <strong>count</strong>?  He is the ruler of a county.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, eventually, border count became a rank above regular count. Thus: <strong>marquis</strong>.</p>
<h3>Viscount</h3>
<p>Is below <strong>count</strong>, the same as the vice president is below the president.</p>
<h3>Baron</h3>
<p>Is the bottom of the totem pole. But these are all <strong>barons</strong>, to hear some people tell it. When the <strong>king</strong> is at odds with his <strong>barons</strong>, and they’re making him sign the Magna Carta, you can bet that the <strong>dukes</strong>, <strong>marqueses</strong>, <strong>earls</strong>, <strong>counts</strong>, and <strong>viscounts</strong> are standing with the <strong>barons</strong>, not with the <strong>king</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, to hear some tell it, a <strong>baron</strong> is anybody who holds directly from the <strong>king</strong>. So the <strong>dukes and such are literally barons</strong>.  They just don’t call themselves that because they have more impressive titles.</p>

<p>Beware: things can switch up on you every time you cross into a new country or a new century.</p>
