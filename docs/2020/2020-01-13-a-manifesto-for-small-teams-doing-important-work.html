<h2>A manifesto for small teams doing important work</h2>
<p>If you make a promise, set a date. No date, no promise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seth’s blog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are always under tight deadlines, because time is our most valuable asset.</p>
<p><strong>If you make a promise, set a date. No date, no promise.</strong></p>
<p>If you set a date, meet it.</p>
<p>If you can’t make a date, tell us early and often. Plan B well prepared is a better strategy than hope.</p>
<p>Clean up your own mess.</p>
<p>Clean up other people’s messes.</p>
<p><em>==Overcommunicate.==</em></p>
<p>Question premises and strategy.</p>
<p>Don’t question goodwill, effort or intent.</p>
<p>“I’ll know it when I see it,” is not a professional thing to say. Describing and discussing in the abstract is what we do.</p>
<p>Make mistakes, own them, fix them, share the learning.</p>
<p>Cheap, reliable, public software might be boring, but it’s usually better. Because it’s cheap and reliable.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s hierarchy is not nearly as important as today’s project structure.</p>
<p><strong>Lock in the things that must be locked in, leave the implementation loose until you figure out how it can get done.</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, we do things that haven’t been done before, so don’t be surprised when you’re surprised.</p>
<p>Care more.</p>
<p>Always be seeking outside resources. A better rolodex is better, even if we don’t have rolodexes any more.</p>
<p>Talk to everyone as if they were your boss, your customer, the founder, your employee. It’s all the same.</p>
<p>It works because it’s personal.</p>
