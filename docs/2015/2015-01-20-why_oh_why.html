<blockquote>
<p>If a writer wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor <strong>Hugo</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of man’s proper stature – and that the rest will betray it. <strong>It is those few that move the world</strong> and give life its meaning – and it is those few that I have always sought to address. The rest are no concern of mine; it is not me […] that they will betray: it is their own souls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ayn <strong>Rand</strong>, New York – May 1968</p>
