<h2>Peace and the Borgias</h2>
<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had <em>warfare</em>, <em>terror</em>, <em>murder</em>, <em>bloodshed</em>, but they produced <em>Michelangelo</em>, Leonardo <em>da Vinci</em> and <strong>the Renaissance</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Switzerland, they had <em>brotherly love</em> â€“ they had five hundred years of <em>democracy</em> and <em>peace</em>, and what did that produce? The <strong>cuckoo clock</strong>.</p>
