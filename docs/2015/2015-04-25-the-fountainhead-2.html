<pre><code>The Fountainhead (Ayn Rand, 1943)
</code></pre>
<h3>How to rule men</h3>
<p>You had to do it. <strong>Who are you to reverse the laws of history?</strong> Do you know what this paper is? The impossible perfect, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind’s great schools of thought. You harnessed him. You made him work for you. You took his achievement, his reward, his money, his glory, his name. We only thought and wrote about it. You gave a practical demonstration. Every philosopher from Plato up should thank you. Here it is, the philosopher’s stone – for turning gold into lead. I should be pleased, but I guess I’m human and I can’t help it, I’m not pleased, I’m just sick. The others, Plato and all the rest, they really thought it would turn lead into gold. I knew the truth from the first. <strong>I’ve been honest with myself, Peter, and that’s the hardest form of honesty. The one you all run from at any price.</strong> And right now I don’t blame you, it is the hardest one, Peter.</p>
<p>You make me sick. God, how you make me sick, all you hypocritical sentimentalists! <strong>You go along with me, you spout what I teach you, you profit by it – but you haven’t the grace to admit to yourself what you’re doing.</strong> You turn green when you see the truth. I suppose that’s in the nature of your natures and that’s precisely my chief weapon – but God! I get tired of it. I must allow myself a moment free of you. That’s what I have to put on an act for all my life – for mean little mediocrities like you. To protect your sensibilities, your posturings, your conscience and the peace of the mind you haven’t got. <strong>That’s the price I pay for what I want – but at least I know that I’ve got to pay it. And I have no illusions about the price or the purchase.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. <strong>It’s not my fault if you couldn’t hear. You could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer than deafness – for me. I said I intended to rule. Like all my spiritual predecessors.</strong> But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule.</p>
<p>— Whom…?</p>
<p>You. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. <strong>If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, the soul.</strong> Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. <strong>The soul, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped.</strong> Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine.</p>
<p>There are many ways. Here’s one.</p>
<h6>Make man feel small.</h6>
<p>Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructive of all integrity. <strong>Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will.</strong> His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue – and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? <strong>His soul gives up its self-respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey.</strong> He’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way.</p>
<p>Here’s another.</p>
<h6>Kill man’s sense of values.</h6>
<p><strong>Kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled.</strong> We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. <strong>Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept – and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection.</strong></p>
<p>Laugh at the great and hold the mediocre as a great architect. You’ve destroyed architecture. Build up [some morrow] and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail [other morrow] and you’ve destroyed the theater. Glorify [third morrow] and you’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten men. <strong>Enshrine mediocrity – and the shrines are razed.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s another way. This is most important.</p>
<h6>Don’t allow men to be happy.</h6>
<p>Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. <strong>Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living.</strong> Take away from them whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. <strong>Bring them to a state where saying I want’ is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this.</strong> Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so shocked. <strong>This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy?</strong> Under all the complications of verbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song – <em>’Give up, give up, give up, give up’</em>? <strong>Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy – and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat.</strong> Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails – go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don’t go to the movies on Sunday – don’t try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned.</p>
<p><strong>But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly – ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men.</strong> Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don’t have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Universal Harmony</em></li>
<li><em>Eternal Spirit</em></li>
<li><em>Divine Purpose</em></li>
<li><em>Nirvana</em></li>
<li><em>Paradise</em></li>
<li><strong>Racial Supremacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. <strong>Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run. Run faster than from a plague.</strong> It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone being served.</p>
<p><strong>The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master.</strong></p>
<p>But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who’s not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. *But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster.*<strong>So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.</strong> But here you might have noticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? <strong>Men have a weapon against you.</strong></p>
<h6>Reason.</h6>
<p><strong>So you must be very sure to take it away from them.</strong> Cut the props from under it. But be careful. Don’t deny outright. <strong>Never deny anything outright, you give your hand away.</strong> Don’t say reason is evil – though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. <strong>Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above it. What? You don’t have to be too clear about it either.</strong> The field’s inexhaustible.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Instinct</em></li>
<li><em>Feeling</em></li>
<li><em>Revelation</em></li>
<li><em>Divine Intuition</em></li>
<li><em>Dialectic Materialism</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn’t make sense – you’re ready for him. <strong>You tell him that there’s something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild.</strong> Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. <strong>Can you rule a thinking man? We don’t want any thinking men.</strong></p>
<h3>…and the World of the Future</h3>
<p>The world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. <strong>A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought of the brain of his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought</strong> – and so on around the globe. <strong>Since all must agree with all.</strong> A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who’ll have no desires – around the globe. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows – their good opinion – <strong>the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain.</strong></p>
<p>Judgment! Not judgment, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeroes – since no individuality will be permitted. A world with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men like me. <strong>Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve liked and accepted those names.</strong> You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general. Do you know the proper antonym for Ego? Bromide. The rule of the bromide. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited submission – from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it ‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no other distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement.</p>
<p>Now if you were a little more intelligent you’d ask: What of us, the rulers? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. <strong>I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good.</strong> Peter, my poor old friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve every known. I have less independence than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I want nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them. It’s my only function and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. <strong>I want power. I want my world of the future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery – without even the dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle – and a total equality.</strong> The world of the future.</p>
<h3>But then, unite and rule</h3>
<p>Insane? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it coming? Isn’t it here? Every single thing I told you? Everything I said is contained in a single word – <strong>collectivism</strong>. And isn’t that the god of our century? To act together. To think – together. To feel – together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. <strong>Divide and conquer – first. But then – unite and rule.</strong> We’ve discovered that one at last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. <strong>We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism.</strong> Look at Europe, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence?</p>
<p>One country is dedicated to the proposition that <strong>man has no rights, that the collective is all</strong>. The individual held as evil, the mass – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat. That’s one version. Here’s another.</p>
<p>A country dedicated to the proposition that <strong>man has no rights, that the State is all</strong>. The individual held as evil, the race – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the race.</p>
<p>If you’re sick of one version, we push you into the other. We get you coming and going. We’ve closed the doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism, and tails – collectivism. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council – or give it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique, Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. <strong>Give the fools a choice, let them have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically.</strong> Observe the state of the world as of the present moment. Do you still think I’m crazy?</p>
<hr />
<h3>Against the men of their time</h3>
<p>Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received – hatred. <strong>The great creators – the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors – stood alone against the men of their time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every great new thought was opposed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every great new invention was denounced.</strong></p>
<p>The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. <strong>They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.</strong></p>
<h3>The individual mind</h3>
<p>But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. <strong>The primary act – the process of reason – must be performed by each man alone.</strong> We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.</p>
<p>We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. We make a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end product of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. <strong>This creative faculty cannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual men.</strong> That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can give another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of survival.</p>
<h3>Altruism</h3>
<p>The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.</p>
<p>The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self.</p>
<p><strong>No man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share his body.</strong> But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation and reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been taught every precept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence as a virtue.</p>
<p>The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality – the man who lives to serve others – is the slave. If physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit? The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resisted and of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence of altruism.</p>
<p><strong>Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution – or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yet we are taught to admire the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who made the gifts possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement.</strong></p>
<h3>The greatest fraud</h3>
<p>Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. <strong>But the creator is the man who disagrees.</strong> Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. <strong>But the creator is the man who goes against the current.</strong> Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. <strong>But the creator is the man who stands alone.</strong></p>
<p>Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. <strong>But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act.</strong> These are functions of the self.</p>
<p>Here the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man has been left no alternative – and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was offered two conceptions: egotism and altruism. Egotism was held to mean the sacrifice of others to self. Altruism – the sacrifice of self to others. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was closed. <strong>Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal – under the threat that sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind.</strong></p>
<p>This was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as fundamentals of life. The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. <strong>The choice is independence or dependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This is the basic issue.</strong></p>
<h3>Personal dignity</h3>
<p>Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man’s independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. <strong>What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity.</strong> There is no standard of personal dignity except independence.</p>
<h3>Destroying the creators</h3>
<p><strong>The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to himself.</strong> His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator.</p>
<p>A man thinks and works alone. <strong>A man cannot rob, exploit or rule – alone. Robbery, exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are the province of the second-hander.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rulers of men are not egotists. They create nothing. They exist entirely through the persons of others.</strong> Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of enslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and the bandit. The form of dependence does not matter.</p>
<p><strong>But men were taught to regard second-handers – tyrants, emperors, dictators – as exponents of egotism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego, themselves and others.</strong> The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or to harness them. Which is a synonym.</p>
<h3>Observe the results</h3>
<p>From the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the first second-hander responded. He invented altruism.</p>
<p><strong>The creator – denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited – went on, moved forward and carried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed nothing to the process except the impediments.</strong> The contest has another name: the individual against the collective.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘common good’ of a collective – a race, a class, a state – was the claim and justification of every tyranny ever established over men.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive.</strong> Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism? Does the fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle?</p>
<p><strong>The most dreadful butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect society reached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned their right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose.</strong> It was accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men.</p>
<p>Actors change, but the course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts with declarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood. <strong>It goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish.</strong> That permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leaders of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Civilization</h3>
<p>It is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. <strong>Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy.</strong> The savage’s whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. <strong>Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater, the ancient monster, has broken loose and is running amuck.</strong> It has brought men to a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth. It has reached a scale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind.</p>
<p>I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live.</p>
