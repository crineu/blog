      <p>To judge by the descriptions that reach us from the ancients, they felt somewhat like this during their “church services.”</p>
<p>But they served their <strong>nonsensical, unknown god</strong>; we serve our <strong>rational god</strong>, whom we know most thoroughly.</p>
<p>Their god gave them <strong>nothing but eternal, torturing seeking</strong>; our god gives us <strong>absolute truth</strong> – that is, he has rid us of any kind of doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their god did not invent anything cleverer than sacrificing oneself, nobody knows what for; we bring to our god, the United State, a quiet, rational, carefully thought-out sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– We, from Zamyatin Yevgeny</p>
