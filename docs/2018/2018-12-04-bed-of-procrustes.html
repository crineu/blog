<p>If something looks irrational – and has been so for a long time – odds are you have a wrong definition of rationality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Nicholas Nassim <em>Taleb</em></p>
<p><img src="../images/bed_procrustes.jpg" alt="Bed of Procrustes" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who can’t do shouldn’t teach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The general principle of antifragility: it is much better to do things you cannot explain than explain things you cannot do.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the medical and social domains, treatment should never be equivalent to silencing symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You never win an argument until they attack your person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Religion isn’t so much about telling man that there is one God as about preventing man from thinking that he is God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Atheists are just modern versions of religious fundamentalists: both take religion too literally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education makes the wise slightly wiser, but it makes the fool vastly more dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology can degrade (and endanger) every aspect of a sucker’s life while convincing him that it is becoming more “efficient.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The twentieth century was the bankruptcy of the social utopia; the twenty-first will be that of the technological one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The calamity of the information age is that the toxicity of data increases much faster than its benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social media are severely antisocial, health foods are empirically unhealthy, knowledge workers are very ignorant, and social sciences aren’t scientific at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most mistakes get worse when you try to correct them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soldiers are more loyal to their comrades (and willing to die for them) than to their country. Academics are more loyal to their peers than to truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The classical man’s worst fear was inglorious death; the modern man’s worst fear is just death.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All rumors about a public figure are to be deemed untrue until he threatens to sue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To bankrupt a fool, give him information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any action one takes with the aim of winning an award, any award, corrupts to the core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you know, in the morning, what your day looks like with any precision, you are a little bit dead – the more precision, the more dead you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If my detractors knew me better they would hate me even more.</p>

<h2>The Title of the Book</h2>
<p>This leads to sucker problems: when the map does not correspond to the territory, there is a certain category of fool – the overeducated, the academic, the journalist, the newspaper reader, the mechanistic “scientist,” the pseudo-empiricist, those endowed with what I call “epistemic arrogance,” this wonderful ability to discount what they did not see, the unobserved – who enter a state of denial, imagining the territory as fitting his map.</p>
<p>More generally, <strong>the fool here is someone who does the wrong reduction for the sake of reduction, or removes something essential, cutting off the legs, or, better, part of the head of a visitor while insisting that he preserved his persona with 95 percent accuracy</strong>. Look around at the Procrustean beds we’ve created, some beneficial, some more questionable: regulations, top-down governments, academia, gyms, commutes, high-rise office buildings, involuntary human relationships, employment, etc.</p>
