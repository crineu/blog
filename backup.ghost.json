Os cristãos interromperam o costume após sua abolição no Concílio de Jerusalém - em 49 d.C. Os muçulmanos perpetuam o costume, embora não haja menção alguma no alcorão.\\n\\n######Expulsão\\nSegundo o Gênesis, Sara mandou e Abraão expulsou Agar e Ismael de casa.\\nSegundo o Alcorão, Deus mandou Abraão mandá-los embora, mas o local onde eles foram encontrados deu origem a um acampamento que por sua vez originou a cidade de **Meca**.\\n\\nAs histórias de Isaac no Gênesis são as histórias de Ismael no Alcorão.\\n\\n---\\n##José\\nDe **Isaac** nasceu **Jacó**. De Jacó nasceu José.\\nFilho mais amado, gerou ciúmes nos irmãos a ponto de decidirem matá-lo. Judá, um deles, o salvou, vendendo-o como escravo no Egito. Foi preso, mas lia sonhos, e previu a fome que viria. Foi ouvido, o Egito escapou, e Jacó, na miséria, enviou os irmãos a ele para implorarem por comida.\\n\\nJosé se revelou e toda sua família foi para lá. Fim.\\n\\n---\\n##Maomé\\nAdão, Noé, Abraão, Jacó, José, Moisés, Jesus.\\nPara os muçulmanos, essa cadeia termina em Maomé, o último profeta.\\n\\nNascido ali por 570, em Meca, Maomé é filho de Abdulah bin Abdu L’Muttalib e Aminah, e descendente direto de **Ismael**. O pai morreu antes dele nascer, e a mãe aos 6 anos. Viveu com o avô paterno, L’Muttalib, por 2 anos. Esse também morreu, e Maomé foi criado pelo tio Abu Talib. Casou com Khadija e acolheu em sua casa o filho de Abu Talib, **Ali**.\\n\\nDepois dos 40, Maomé começou a converter o pessoal. Os primeiros foram Khadija, Ali e Zaid, um ex-escravo. Fora da família, **Abu Bacre** foi o primeiro. Sua mulher morreu, e Maomé casou outras dez vezes. Perto da morte, escreveu o tal do livro lá.\\n\\n#####Cinco pilares do Islamismo\\n* *shahãdah*: acreditar em um só Deus e em Maomé como último profeta;\\n* *salat*: orar cinco vezes por dia voltado para Meca;\\n* *zakat*: dar esmola visando a caridade;\\n* *saum* ou *siyam*: jejuar durante o mês do Ramadã, do nascer do dia ao cair da noite;\\n* *haji*: fazer a peregrinação a Meca pelo menos uma vez na vida\\n\\n#####Sucessão do profeta\\nSegundo os *Sunitas*, Abu Bacre e Omar são fiéis companheiros e Ayishah a esposa amada e devotada.\\nSegundo os *Xiitas*, os três são traidores pérfidos, Ayishah uma amaldiçoada e Abu Bacre um praga. Ali é o bem-amado do profeta.\\n\\n#####Os 4 califas\\n1. *Abu Bacre*: governou por 2 anos; morreu de causas naturais, provavelmente envenenado;\\n1. *Omar*: governou por 10 anos e foi assassinado pelo seu escravo Abu Lu’lu’a;\\n1. *Osman*: governou por 12 anos e foi assassinado;\\n1. *Ali*: Não era politicamente apto, e também foi assassinado.\\n\\n---\\n##Deuteronômio\\nUm dos livros divinamente revelado segundo cristãos e judeus, cita 15 os crimes punidos com a morte:\\n\\n1. adultério;\\n1. sexo com animais;\\n1. blasfêmia;\\n1. falso testemunho em casos cuja punição seja a morte;\\n1. falsos profetas;\\n1. idolatria;\\n1. incesto;\\n1. insubordinação às decisões de juízes ou sacerdotes;\\n1. sequestro;\\n1. licenciosidade por parte da filha de sacedotes;\\n1. estupro de mulher prometida em casamento;\\n1. bater ou amaldçoar pai ou mãe;\\n1. não respeitar o *shabat*;\\n1. feitiçaria e adivinhação;\\n1. assassinato\\n\\n---\\n##Irmandade Muçulmana\\nCriada em 1928 por *Hasan al-Banna* no Egito. Em 1934 já possuía 50 filiais no Egito. Em 1939 passou a atuar como grupo político. Em 1945 aderiu à violência e ao terror.\\n\\nEm 1950 o grupo recebeu o apoio do coronel *Gamal Abd al-Nasser*, que também tentava derrubar a monarquia. Em 1954, porém, quando Nasser assumiu o poder, a Irmandade foi posta mais uma vez na ilegalidade. Após tentarem assassinar Nasser, o governo egípcio tomou a atitude mais desastrada de todas: prendeu 4 mil membros e expulsou do país outros milhares. E assim a Irmandade se espalhou pela Síria, Arábia Saudita, Jordânia e Líbano.\\n\\nDepois de al-Banna ser assassinado, surgiu *Qutub*, o maluco que fez estágio na América e odiou. Adentrou a Irmandade em 1951, e virou o principal teórico. Publicou *Sinalizações na Estrada*, considerada a bíblia do terror islâmico. Foi julgado e enforcado em 1966\\n\\n#####Grande apoio\\nA Arábia viu na Irmandade apenas ultraconservadores, e os apoiou. Além disso, eles foram apoiados contra os soviéticos, no Afeganistão. Mas já em 1965 Qutub recusava ambos os lados:\\n\\n> Até mesmo o mundo ocidental admite que a civilização ocidental é incapaz de apresentar valores saudáveis para orientar a humanidade. Sabe que não possui nada que satisfaça sua própria consciência e justifique sua existência. A democracia ocidental tornou-se estéril, a tal ponto que vem tomando emprestados elementos dos sistemas do bloco oriental, principalmente no tocante ao sistema econômico, sob o nome de socialismo. O mesmo ocorre no bloco oriental. Suas teorias sociais, das quais a principal é o marxismo, inicialmente atraíram não somente muitos seguidores no mundo oriental, mas também no Ocidente, por ser um estilo de vida baseado numa crença. Hoje, o marxismo foi derrotado no plano das idéias, e não será exagero afirmar que nenhuma nação no mundo é verdadeiramente marxista. De maneira geral, essa teoria está em desacordo com a natureza e as necessidades humanas. Essa ideologia só prospera em uma sociedade degenerada, ou em uma sociedade que se tornou acuada diante de alguma forma de ditadura prolongada. Atualmente, porém, mesmo nessas circunstâncias, seu sistema econômico materialista vem fracassando, embora tenha sido a única base de sustentação de sua estrutura. A Rússia, líder dos países comunistas, vem sofrendo com a escassez de alimentos. Embora na época dos czares a Rússia produzisse superávits de alimentos, hoje tem que importar alimentos do exterior, e, para isso, vender suas reservas de ouro. O principal motivo dessa situação foi a falência do sistema de propriedades agrícolas coletivas, ou, em outras palavras, o fracasso de um sistema que vai contra a natureza humana.\\\"\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>Sobre o Islã (Ali Kamel, 2005)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"abro\">Abrão</h2>\n<p>Viajou com sua mulher Sarai para Canaã.

The spirit of this argument – known as TINA – permeates the way globalization is portrayed by the Bad Samaritans.\\n\\nThe Bad Samaritans like to present globalization as an inevitable result of relentless developments in the technologies of communication and transportation. Going against this historical tide only produces disasters, it is argued, as evidenced by the collapse of the world economy during the inter-war period and by the failures of state-led industrialization in the developing countries in the 1960s and the 1970s.\\n\\nTINA conclusion stems from a fundamentally defective understanding of the forces driving globalization and a distortion of history to fit the theory. **Free trade was often imposed on, rather than chosen by, weaker countries**. Most countries that had the choice did not choose free trade for more than brief periods. **Virtually all successful economies, developed and developing, got where they are through selective, strategic integration with the world economy, rather than through unconditional global integration**. The performance of the developing countries was much better when they had a large amount of policy autonomy during the ‘bad old days’ of state-led industrialization than when they were totally deprived of it during the first globalization (in the era of colonial rule and unequal treaties) or when they had much less policy autonomy (as in the past quarter of a century).\\n\\nThere is nothing inevitable about globalization, because it is driven more by politics (that is, human will and decision) than technology, as the Bad Samaritans claim. If it were technology that determined the extent of globalization, it would be impossible to explain how the world was much less globalized in the 1970s (when we had all the modern technologies of transport and communication except the internet) than in the 1870s (when we relied on steamships and wired telegraphy). Technology only defines the outer boundaries of globalization. Exactly what shape it takes depends on what we do with national policies and what international agreements we make. If that is the case, the TINA thesis is wrong. There is an alternative, or rather there are many alternatives, to the neo-liberal globalization that is happening today.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Trade => Economic Development\\n\\nIn the end, **economic development is about acquiring and mastering advanced technologies**. In theory, a country can develop such technologies on its own, but such a strategy of technological self-sufficiency quickly hits the wall. This is why all successful cases of economic development have involved serious attempts to get hold of and master advanced foreign technologies.\\n\\nBut to import technologies from developed countries, developing nations need foreign currency to pay for them – whether they want to buy directly (e.g., technology licences, technology consultancy services) or indirectly (e.g., better machines). Some of the necessary foreign currency may be provided through gifts from rich countries (foreign aid), but most has to be earned through exports. **Without trade, therefore, there will be little technological progress and thus little economic development**.\\n\\n> There is a huge difference between saying that trade is essential for economic development and saying that free trade is best (or, at least, that freer trade is better) for economic development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### “...worse than being exploited by capital...”\\n\\nLike Joan Robinson, a former Cambridge economics professor and arguably the most famous female economist in history, I believe that the only thing that is worse than being exploited by capital **is not being exploited by capital**. Foreign investment, especially foreign direct investment, can be a very useful tool for economic development. But how useful it is depends on the kind of investiment made an how the host country government regulates it.\\n\\nForeign finantial investiment brings more danger than benefits, as even neo-liberals acknowledge these days. It often bring benefits *in the short run*, **but is the long run that counts when it comes to economic development**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### State-owned Enterprises\\n\\nThe picture regarding the management of SOE is complex. There are good state-owned enterprises, and there are bad state-owned enterprises. Even for a similar problem, public ownership may be the right solution in one context and not in another. Many problems that dog SOEs also affect large private-sector firms with dispersed ownership. Privatization sometimes works well, but can be a recipe for disaster, especially in developing countries that lack the necessary regulatory capabilities. Even when privatization is the right solution, it may be difficult to get it right in practice. But there are some general lessons that we can draw from economic theories and real life examples.\\n\\nEnterprises in industries that are **natural monopolies**, industries that **involve large investment and high risk** and enterprises that **provide essential services** should be kept as SOEs, unless the government has very high tax-raising and/or regulatory capabilities.\\n\\nOther things being equal, there is a greater need for SOEs in the developing countries than in the developed countries, as they have underdeveloped capital markets and weak regulatory and taxation capabilities. SOE performance can often be improved without privatization:\\n\\n* One important thing to do is to review critically the goals of the enterprises and establish **clear priorities among them**. Very often, public enterprises are charged with serving too many goals. There is nothing wrong with this, but what the goals are and the relative priority among them need to be made clear;\\n* **The monitoring system** can also be improved. In many countries, SOEs are monitored by multiple agencies, which means either that they are not meaningfully supervised by any particular agency or that there is a supervisory over-kill that disrupts daily management;\\n* **Increase in competition** can also be important. More competition is not always better, but **competition is often the best way to improve enterprise performance**. Public enterprises that are not natural monopolies can easily be made to compete with private-sector firms, both domestically or in the export market.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Getting the balance right\\n\\nCriticizing the IPR regime as it exists today is not the same as arguing for the wholesale abolition of intellectual property itself. Patents, copyrights and trademarks do serve useful purposes. But the fact that some protection of intellectual property rights is beneficial, or even necessary, does not mean that more of it is always better. Some minimum amount of protection of intellectual property rights may be essential in creating incentives for knowledge creation. Some more of it may bring more benefits than costs. But too much of it may create more costs than benefits so that it ends up harming the economy.\\n\\nSo the real question is not whether IPR protection is good or bad in principle. **It is how we get the balance right between the need to encourage people to produce new knowledge and the need to ensure that the costs from the resulting monopoly do not exceed the benefits that the new knowledge brings about**. In order to do that, we need to weaken the degree of IPR protection prevailing today – by shortening the period of protection, by raising the originality bar, and by making compulsory licensing and parallel imports easier.\\n\\n* The international IPR system should be reformed in a way that helps developing countries become more productive by allowing them to acquire new technical knowledge at reasonable costs;\\n* Developing countries should be allowed to grant weaker IPRs – shorter patent life, lower licensing royalty rates or easier compulsory licensing and parallel imports;\\n* We should not only make technology acquisition easier for developing countries but also help them develop the capabilities to use and develop more productive technologies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### Macroeconomic policies and Keneysianism\\n\\nMacroeconomic policies – monetary policy and fiscal policy – are intended to change the behaviour of the whole economy (as distinct from the sum total of the behaviours of the individual economic actors that make it up). The counter-intuitive idea that the whole economy may behave differently from the sum total of its parts comes from the famous Cambridge economist John Maynard **Keynes**.\\n\\nKeynes argued that what is rational for individual actors may not be rational for the entire economy. For example, during an economic downturn, firms see the demand for their products fall, while workers face increased chances of redundancy and wage cuts. In this situation, it is prudent for individual firms and workers to reduce their spending. But if all economic actors reduced their expenditure, they will all be worse off, for the combined effect of such actions is a lower aggregate demand, which, in turn, further increases everyone’s chances of bankruptcy and redundancy. Therefore, Keynes argued, the government, whose job it is to manage the whole economy, cannot simply use scaled-up versions of action plans that are rational for individual economic agents. It should always deliberately do the opposite of what other economic actors do. In an economic downturn, therefore, it should increase its spending to counter the tendency of the private sector firms and workers to reduce their spending. In an economic upturn, it should reduce its expenditure and increase taxes, so that it can prevent demand from outstripping supply.\\n\\n#### Kenesianism for the rich, monetarism for the poor\\n\\nWhen the rich countries get into recession, they usually relax monetary policy and increase budget deficits. When the same thing happens in developing countries, the Bad Samaritans, through the IMF, force them to raise interest rates to absurd levels and balance their budgets, or even generate budget surplus – even if these actions treble unemployment and spark riots in the streets.\\n\\nThe Bad Samaritans have imposed macroeconomic policies on developing countries that seriously hamper their ability to invest, grow and create jobs in the long run. The categorical – and simplistic – denunciation of ‘living beyond one’s means’ has made it impossible for them to ‘borrow to invest’ in order to accelerate economic growth. If we categorically denounce people for living beyond their means, we should, amongst other things, condemn young people for borrowing to invest in their career development or in their children’s education. That cannot be right. Living beyond one’s means may or may not be right; it all depends on the stage of development that the country is in and the use to which the borrowed money is put.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Politics and economic development\\n\\n**Corruption** and **lack of democracy** are big problems in many developing countries. But **the relationships between them and economic development are far more complex than suggested**. The failure to think through the complexity of the corruption issue is, for example, why so many developing country politicians who come to power on an anti-corruption platform not only fail to clean up the system but often end up being ousted or even jailed for corruption themselves. **When it comes to democracy, the neo-liberal view that democracy promotes a free market, which, in turn, promotes economic development, is highly problematic**.\\n\\nDeregulation of the economy in general, and the introduction of greater market forces in the management of the government more specifically, has often increased, rather than reduced, corruption. By forcing trade liberalization, the Bad Samaritans have also inadvertently encouraged corruption; the resulting fall in government revenue has depressed public salaries and thus encouraged petty corruption.\\n\\nHaving once dismissed political factors as minor details that should not get in the way of good economics, neo-liberals have recently become very interested in them. The reason is obvious – their economic programme for developing countries as implemented by the Unholy Trinity of the IMF, World Bank and WTO has had spectacular failures (just think of Argentina in the 1990s) and very few successes. Because it is unthinkable to the Bad Samaritans that free trade, privatization and the rest of their policies could be wrong, the ‘explanation’ for policy failure is increasingly found in non-policy factors, such as politics and culture.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n#### Reinventing culture\\n\\nAt a given point in time, a particular culture may produce people with particular behavioural traits that are more conducive to achieving certain social goals, including economic development, than other cultures. At this abstract level, the proposition seems uncontroversial.\\n\\nBut when we try to apply this general principle to actual cases, it proves elusive. It is very difficult to define what the culture of a nation is. Things are complicated further by the fact that very different cultural traditions may co-exist in a single country. All cultures have multiple characteristics, some positive and others negative for economic development. So, **it is not possible, nor useful, to ‘explain’ a country’s economic success or failure in terms of its culture**.\\n\\nEven though certain behavioural traits may be better for economic development, a country does not need a ‘cultural revolution’ before it can develop. Though culture and economic development influence each other, the causality is far stronger from the latter to the former; **economic development to a large extent creates a culture that it needs**. Changes in economic structure change the way people live and interact with one another, which, in turn, changes the way they understand the world and behave. **Many of the behavioural traits that are supposed to ‘explain’ economic development** (e.g., hard work, time-keeping, frugality) **are actually its consequences, rather than its causes**.\\n\\nThe fact that culture can be deliberately changed – through economic policies, institution building and ideological campaigns – gives us hope. **No country is condemned to underdevelopment because of its culture**. But at the same time we must not forget that culture cannot be reinvented at will – the failure to create the ‘new man’ under communism is a good proof of that. The cultural ‘reformer’ still has to work with existing cultural attitudes and symbols.\\n\\n---\\n\\n####In the end\\n\\nWhy manufacturing matters\\nHaving accepted that increasing capabilities is important, where exactly should a country invest in order to increase them? **Industry – or, more precisely, manufacturing industry – is my answer**. It is also the answer that would have been given by generations of successful engineers of economic development from Robert Walpole onwards, had they been asked the same question.\\nOf course, this is not to say that it is impossible to become rich by relying on natural resources. But one has to have a huge stock of natural resources in order to be able to base high living standards solely on them – and few countries are so fortunate. Moreover, natural resources can run out or, worse, wealth based on natural resources can be rapidly eroded.\\n\\n**History has repeatedly shown that the single most important thing that distinguishes rich countries from poor ones is basically their higher capabilities in manufacturing**, where productivity is generally higher, and, more importantly, where productivity tends to (although does not always) grow faster than in agriculture or services. Walpole knew this nearly 300 years ago, when he asked George I to say in the British Parliament: ‘nothing so much contributes to promote the public well-being as the exportation of manufactured goods and the importation of foreign raw material’. In the US, Alexander Hamilton knew it when he defied the world’s then most famous economist, Adam Smith, and argued that his country should promote ‘infant industries’. Many developing countries pursued import substitution ‘industrialization’ in the mid-20th century precisely for this reason. Contrary to the advice of the Bad Samaritans, poor countries should deliberately promote manufacturing industries.\\n\\nOf course, today there are those who challenge this view on the grounds that we are now living in a post-industrial era and that selling services is therefore the way to go. Some of them even argue that developing countries can, and really should, skip industrialization and move directly to the service economy. In particular, many people in India, encouraged by that country’s recent success in service outsourcing, seem to be quite taken by this idea.\\n\\nThere are certainly some services that have high productivity and considerable scope for further productivity growth – banking and other financial services, management consulting, technical consulting and IT support come to mind. But most other services have low productivity and, more importantly, have little scope for productivity growth due to their very nature (how much more ‘efficient’ can a hairdresser, a nurse or a call centre telephonist become without diluting the quality of their services?). Moreover, the most important sources of demand for those high-productivity services are manufacturing firms. So, without a strong manufacturing sector, it is impossible to develop high-productivity services. This is why no country has become rich solely on the basis of its service sector.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>Bad Samaritans – The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism (Ha-Joon Chang, 2013)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"baseideas\">Base Ideas</h2>\n<p>A mixture of economic theory, history and contemporary evidence is deployed to turn much of the conventional wisdom about development on its head.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free trade</strong> reduces freedom of choice for poor countries;</li>\n<li>Keeping foreign companies out may be good for them in the long run;</li>\n<li>Investing in a company that is going to make a loss for 17 years may be an excellent proposition;</li>\n<li>Some of the world’s best firms are <strong>owned and run by the state</strong>;</li>\n<li><em>Borrowing</em> ideas from more productive foreigners is essential for economic development;</li>\n<li>Low inflation and government prudence may be harmful for economic development;</li>\n<li>Corruption exists because there is too much, not too little, market;</li>\n<li><strong>Free market</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong> are not natural partners;</li>\n<li>Countries are poor not because their people are lazy; their people are ‘lazy’ because they are poor.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"introductionarethebadsamaritanswinning\">Introduction — Are the Bad Samaritans winning?</h3>\n<p>Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who spearheaded the neo-liberal counter-revolution, once famously dismissed her critics saying that ‘<em>There is no alternative</em>’. The spirit of this argument – known as TINA – permeates the way globalization is portrayed by the Bad Samaritans.</p>\n<p>The Bad Samaritans like to present globalization as an inevitable result of relentless developments in the technologies of communication and transportation. Going against this historical tide only produces disasters, it is argued, as evidenced by the collapse of the world economy during the inter-war period and by the failures of state-led industrialization in the developing countries in the 1960s and the 1970s.</p>\n<p>TINA conclusion stems from a fundamentally defective understanding of the forces driving globalization and a distortion of history to fit the theory. <strong>Free trade was often imposed on, rather than chosen by, weaker countries</strong>. Most countries that had the choice did not choose free trade for more than brief periods. <strong>Virtually all successful economies, developed and developing, got where they are through selective, strategic integration with the world economy, rather than through unconditional global integration</strong>. The performance of the developing countries was much better when they had a large amount of policy autonomy during the ‘bad old days’ of state-led industrialization than when they were totally deprived of it during the first globalization (in the era of colonial rule and unequal treaties) or when they had much less policy autonomy (as in the past quarter of a century).</p>\n<p>There is nothing inevitable about globalization, because it is driven more by politics (that is, human will and decision) than technology, as the Bad Samaritans claim. If it were technology that determined the extent of globalization, it would be impossible to explain how the world was much less globalized in the 1970s (when we had all the modern technologies of transport and communication except the internet) than in the 1870s (when we relied on steamships and wired telegraphy). Technology only defines the outer boundaries of globalization. Exactly what shape it takes depends on what we do with national policies and what international agreements we make. If that is the case, the TINA thesis is wrong. There is an alternative, or rather there are many alternatives, to the neo-liberal globalization that is happening today.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"tradeeconomicdevelopment\">Trade =&gt; Economic Development</h4>\n<p>In the end, <strong>economic development is about acquiring and mastering advanced technologies</strong>. In theory, a country can develop such technologies on its own, but such a strategy of technological self-sufficiency quickly hits the wall. This is why all successful cases of economic development have involved serious attempts to get hold of and master advanced foreign technologies.</p>\n<p>But to import technologies from developed countries, developing nations need foreign currency to pay for them – whether they want to buy directly (e.g., technology licences, technology consultancy services) or indirectly (e.g., better machines). Some of the necessary foreign currency may be provided through gifts from rich countries (foreign aid), but most has to be earned through exports. <strong>Without trade, therefore, there will be little technological progress and thus little economic development</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a huge difference between saying that trade is essential for economic development and saying that free trade is best (or, at least, that freer trade is better) for economic development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"worsethanbeingexploitedbycapital\">“...worse than being exploited by capital...”</h4>\n<p>Like Joan Robinson, a former Cambridge economics professor and arguably the most famous female economist in history, I believe that the only thing that is worse than being exploited by capital <strong>is not being exploited by capital</strong>. Foreign investment, especially foreign direct investment, can be a very useful tool for economic development. But how useful it is depends on the kind of investiment made an how the host country government regulates it.</p>\n<p>Foreign finantial investiment brings more danger than benefits, as even neo-liberals acknowledge these days. It often bring benefits <em>in the short run</em>, <strong>but is the long run that counts when it comes to economic development</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"stateownedenterprises\">State-owned Enterprises</h4>\n<p>The picture regarding the management of SOE is complex. There are good state-owned enterprises, and there are bad state-owned enterprises. Even for a similar problem, public ownership may be the right solution in one context and not in another. Many problems that dog SOEs also affect large private-sector firms with dispersed ownership. Privatization sometimes works well, but can be a recipe for disaster, especially in developing countries that lack the necessary regulatory capabilities. Even when privatization is the right solution, it may be difficult to get it right in practice. But there are some general lessons that we can draw from economic theories and real life examples.</p>\n<p>Enterprises in industries that are <strong>natural monopolies</strong>, industries that <strong>involve large investment and high risk</strong> and enterprises that <strong>provide essential services</strong> should be kept as SOEs, unless the government has very high tax-raising and/or regulatory capabilities.</p>\n<p>Other things being equal, there is a greater need for SOEs in the developing countries than in the developed countries, as they have underdeveloped capital markets and weak regulatory and taxation capabilities. SOE performance can often be improved without privatization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One important thing to do is to review critically the goals of the enterprises and establish <strong>clear priorities among them</strong>. Very often, public enterprises are charged with serving too many goals. There is nothing wrong with this, but what the goals are and the relative priority among them need to be made clear;</li>\n<li><strong>The monitoring system</strong> can also be improved. In many countries, SOEs are monitored by multiple agencies, which means either that they are not meaningfully supervised by any particular agency or that there is a supervisory over-kill that disrupts daily management;</li>\n<li><strong>Increase in competition</strong> can also be important. More competition is not always better, but <strong>competition is often the best way to improve enterprise performance</strong>. Public enterprises that are not natural monopolies can easily be made to compete with private-sector firms, both domestically or in the export market.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"gettingthebalanceright\">Getting the balance right</h4>\n<p>Criticizing the IPR regime as it exists today is not the same as arguing for the wholesale abolition of intellectual property itself. Patents, copyrights and trademarks do serve useful purposes. But the fact that some protection of intellectual property rights is beneficial, or even necessary, does not mean that more of it is always better. Some minimum amount of protection of intellectual property rights may be essential in creating incentives for knowledge creation. Some more of it may bring more benefits than costs.

But the fact that some protection of\nintellectual property rights is beneficial, or even necessary, does not mean\nthat more of it is always better. Some minimum amount of protection of\nintellectual property rights may be essential in creating incentives for\nknowledge creation. Some more of it may bring more benefits than costs. But too\nmuch of it may create more costs than benefits so that it ends up harming the\neconomy.\n\nSo the real question is not whether IPR protection is good or bad in principle. \nIt is how we get the balance right between the need to encourage people to\nproduce new knowledge and the need to ensure that the costs from the resulting\nmonopoly do not exceed the benefits that the new knowledge brings about. In\norder to do that, we need to weaken the degree of IPR protection prevailing\ntoday – by shortening the period of protection, by raising the originality bar,\nand by making compulsory licensing and parallel imports easier.\n\n * The international IPR system should be reformed in a way that helps\n   developing countries become more productive by allowing them to acquire new\n   technical knowledge at reasonable costs;\n * Developing countries should be allowed to grant weaker IPRs – shorter patent\n   life, lower licensing royalty rates or easier compulsory licensing and\n   parallel imports;\n * We should not only make technology acquisition easier for developing\n   countries but also help them develop the capabilities to use and develop more\n   productive technologies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMacroeconomic policies and Keneysianism\nMacroeconomic policies – monetary policy and fiscal policy – are intended to\nchange the behaviour of the whole economy (as distinct from the sum total of the\nbehaviours of the individual economic actors that make it up). The\ncounter-intuitive idea that the whole economy may behave differently from the\nsum total of its parts comes from the famous Cambridge economist John Maynard \nKeynes.\n\nKeynes argued that what is rational for individual actors may not be rational\nfor the entire economy. For example, during an economic downturn, firms see the\ndemand for their products fall, while workers face increased chances of\nredundancy and wage cuts. In this situation, it is prudent for individual firms\nand workers to reduce their spending. But if all economic actors reduced their\nexpenditure, they will all be worse off, for the combined effect of such actions\nis a lower aggregate demand, which, in turn, further increases everyone’s\nchances of bankruptcy and redundancy. Therefore, Keynes argued, the government,\nwhose job it is to manage the whole economy, cannot simply use scaled-up\nversions of action plans that are rational for individual economic agents. It\nshould always deliberately do the opposite of what other economic actors do. In\nan economic downturn, therefore, it should increase its spending to counter the\ntendency of the private sector firms and workers to reduce their spending. In an\neconomic upturn, it should reduce its expenditure and increase taxes, so that it\ncan prevent demand from outstripping supply.\n\nKenesianism for the rich, monetarism for the poor\nWhen the rich countries get into recession, they usually relax monetary policy\nand increase budget deficits. When the same thing happens in developing\ncountries, the Bad Samaritans, through the IMF, force them to raise interest\nrates to absurd levels and balance their budgets, or even generate budget\nsurplus – even if these actions treble unemployment and spark riots in the\nstreets.\n\nThe Bad Samaritans have imposed macroeconomic policies on developing countries\nthat seriously hamper their ability to invest, grow and create jobs in the long\nrun. The categorical – and simplistic – denunciation of ‘living beyond one’s\nmeans’ has made it impossible for them to ‘borrow to invest’ in order to\naccelerate economic growth. If we categorically denounce people for living\nbeyond their means, we should, amongst other things, condemn young people for\nborrowing to invest in their career development or in their children’s\neducation. That cannot be right. Living beyond one’s means may or may not be\nright; it all depends on the stage of development that the country is in and the\nuse to which the borrowed money is put.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPolitics and economic development\nCorruption and lack of democracy are big problems in many developing countries.\nBut the relationships between them and economic development are far more complex\nthan suggested. The failure to think through the complexity of the corruption\nissue is, for example, why so many developing country politicians who come to\npower on an anti-corruption platform not only fail to clean up the system but\noften end up being ousted or even jailed for corruption themselves. When it\ncomes to democracy, the neo-liberal view that democracy promotes a free market,\nwhich, in turn, promotes economic development, is highly problematic.\n\nDeregulation of the economy in general, and the introduction of greater market\nforces in the management of the government more specifically, has often\nincreased, rather than reduced, corruption. By forcing trade liberalization, the\nBad Samaritans have also inadvertently encouraged corruption; the resulting fall\nin government revenue has depressed public salaries and thus encouraged petty\ncorruption.\n\nHaving once dismissed political factors as minor details that should not get in\nthe way of good economics, neo-liberals have recently become very interested in\nthem. The reason is obvious – their economic programme for developing countries\nas implemented by the Unholy Trinity of the IMF, World Bank and WTO has had\nspectacular failures (just think of Argentina in the 1990s) and very few\nsuccesses. Because it is unthinkable to the Bad Samaritans that free trade,\nprivatization and the rest of their policies could be wrong, the ‘explanation’\nfor policy failure is increasingly found in non-policy factors, such as politics\nand culture.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReinventing culture\nAt a given point in time, a particular culture may produce people with\nparticular behavioural traits that are more conducive to achieving certain\nsocial goals, including economic development, than other cultures. At this\nabstract level, the proposition seems uncontroversial.\n\nBut when we try to apply this general principle to actual cases, it proves\nelusive. It is very difficult to define what the culture of a nation is. Things\nare complicated further by the fact that very different cultural traditions may\nco-exist in a single country. All cultures have multiple characteristics, some\npositive and others negative for economic development. So, it is not possible,\nnor useful, to ‘explain’ a country’s economic success or failure in terms of its\nculture.\n\nEven though certain behavioural traits may be better for economic development, a\ncountry does not need a ‘cultural revolution’ before it can develop. Though\nculture and economic development influence each other, the causality is far\nstronger from the latter to the former; economic development to a large extent\ncreates a culture that it needs. Changes in economic structure change the way\npeople live and interact with one another, which, in turn, changes the way they\nunderstand the world and behave. Many of the behavioural traits that are\nsupposed to ‘explain’ economic development (e.g., hard work, time-keeping,\nfrugality) are actually its consequences, rather than its causes.\n\nThe fact that culture can be deliberately changed – through economic policies,\ninstitution building and ideological campaigns – gives us hope. No country is\ncondemned to underdevelopment because of its culture. But at the same time we\nmust not forget that culture cannot be reinvented at will – the failure to\ncreate the ‘new man’ under communism is a good proof of that. The cultural\n‘reformer’ still has to work with existing cultural attitudes and symbols.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end\nWhy manufacturing matters\nHaving accepted that increasing capabilities is important, where exactly should\na country invest in order to increase them? Industry – or, more precisely,\nmanufacturing industry – is my answer. It is also the answer that would have\nbeen given by generations of successful engineers of economic development from\nRobert Walpole onwards, had they been asked the same question.\nOf course, this is not to say that it is impossible to become rich by relying on\nnatural resources. But one has to have a huge stock of natural resources in\norder to be able to base high living standards solely on them – and few\ncountries are so fortunate. Moreover, natural resources can run out or, worse,\nwealth based on natural resources can be rapidly eroded.\n\nHistory has repeatedly shown that the single most important thing that\ndistinguishes rich countries from poor ones is basically their higher\ncapabilities in manufacturing, where productivity is generally higher, and, more\nimportantly, where productivity tends to (although does not always) grow faster\nthan in agriculture or services. Walpole knew this nearly 300 years ago, when he\nasked George I to say in the British Parliament: ‘nothing so much contributes to\npromote the public well-being as the exportation of manufactured goods and the\nimportation of foreign raw material’. In the US, Alexander Hamilton knew it when\nhe defied the world’s then most famous economist, Adam Smith, and argued that\nhis country should promote ‘infant industries’. Many developing countries\npursued import substitution ‘industrialization’ in the mid-20th century\nprecisely for this reason. Contrary to the advice of the Bad Samaritans, poor\ncountries should deliberately promote manufacturing industries.\n\nOf course, today there are those who challenge this view on the grounds that we\nare now living in a post-industrial era and that selling services is therefore\nthe way to go. Some of them even argue that developing countries can, and really\nshould, skip industrialization and move directly to the service economy. In\nparticular, many people in India, encouraged by that country’s recent success in\nservice outsourcing, seem to be quite taken by this idea.\n\nThere are certainly some services that have high productivity and considerable\nscope for further productivity growth – banking and other financial services,\nmanagement consulting, technical consulting and IT support come to mind. But\nmost other services have low productivity and, more importantly, have little\nscope for productivity growth due to their very nature (how much more\n‘efficient’ can a hairdresser, a nurse or a call centre telephonist become\nwithout diluting the quality of their services?). Moreover, the most important\nsources of demand for those high-productivity services are manufacturing firms.\nSo, without a strong manufacturing sector, it is impossible to develop\nhigh-productivity services. This is why no country has become rich solely on the\nbasis of its service sector.","feature_image":"http://blogs.bible.org/sites/blogs.bible.org/files/u198/Woman%20at%20the%20Well%20by%20M%20Belk_0.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-02-23 01:37:04","updated_at":"2017-05-02 19:51:36","published_at":"2015-01-22 09:17:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5baa33d40283b4635b8c9857","uuid":"31736a49-6723-4f45-ae3e-16b73133d424","title":"[book] Steve Yegge resume","slug":"steve-yegge-resume","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"    A Programmer’s Rantings: On Programming-Language Religions, Code Philosophies, Google Work Culture, and Other Stuff (Steve Yegge, 2012)\\n\\n#### Little note to programmers\\n\\n> READ THE WHOLE BOOK\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Math for programmers\\n\\nYou need to learn\\n\\n* **Probabilities**\\n* **Discrete math** (math on integers)\\n* **Statistics**\\n* **Algebra** and **Linear Algebra** (matrices)\\n* **Mathematical Logic** (whatever it is)\\n* **Information Theory** (data compression) and **Kolmogorov Complexity** (algorithmic complexity)\\n\\n> I think the best way to start learning math is to spend 15 to 30 minutes a day surfing in Wikipedia.

The lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel beams, and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry. It was difficult, at times. Between him and the plan of the building on which he was working stood the plan of that building as it should have been. He saw what he could make of it, how to change the lines he drew, where to lead them in order to achieve a thing of splendor. **He had to choke the knowledge. He had to kill the vision. He had to obey […] as instructed. It hurt him so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger**.\\n\\n**But the pain remained--and a helpless wonder**. The thing he saw was so much more real than the reality of paper, office and commission. **He could not understand what made others blind to it**, and what made their indifference possible. [...] **He wondered why ineptitude should exist and have its say**. He had never known that. And the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him.\\n\\n\\n### An expert speaks about architecture...\\n\\nAnd thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact that we deal in nothing. We create emptiness through which certain physical bodies are to move – we shall designate them for convenience as humans. By emptiness I mean what is commonly known as rooms. Thus it is only the crass layman who thinks that we put up stone walls. We do nothing of the kind. We put up emptiness, **as I have proved**. This leads us to a corollary of astronomical importance: to the **unconditional acceptance of the premise that ‘absence’ is superior to ‘presence’. That is, to the acceptance of non-acceptance**. I shall state this in simpler terms – for the sake of clarity: **’nothing’ is superior to ‘something’**. Thus it is clear that the architect is more than a bricklayer – since the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion anyway. The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to face the primal conception of reality as nonreality – since there is nothing and he creates nothingness. If this sounds like a contradiction, **it is not a proof of bad logic, but of a higher logic**, the dialectics of all life and art. Should you wish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic conception, **you may come to conclusions of vast sociological importance. You may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to a non-beautiful one, that the literate is inferior to the illiterate, that the rich is inferior to the poor, and the able to the incompetent**. The architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox. Let us be modest in the vast pride of this realization. Everything else is twaddle.\\n\\n\\n#### ...and the result is:\\n\\nThe Council of American Builders met once a month and *engaged in no tangible activity*, beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer. Its membership did not grow fast either in quantity or in quality. *There were no concrete results achieved.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A dead issue\\n\\nIt will prove nothing, whether he wins or loses. […] All of it will be forgotten before Christmas.\\n\\nRight, my dear, everything will be forgotten by next Christmas. And that, you see, will be the achievement. **You can fight a live issue. You can’t fight a dead one.** Dead issues, like all dead things, don’t just vanish, but leave some decomposing matter behind. A most unpleasant thing to carry on your name. Mr. H will be thoroughly forgotten. The Temple will be forgotten. The lawsuit will be forgotten. But here’s what will remain: ‘Howard Roark? Why, how could you trust a man like that? He’s an enemy of religion. He’s completely immortal. First thing you know, he’ll gyp you on your construction costs.’ ‘Roark? He’s no good – why, a client had to sue him because he made such a botch of a building.’ ‘Roark? Wait a moment, isn’t that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of a mess? Now what was it? Some rotten kind of scandal, the owner of the building […] had to sue him. You don’t want to get involved with a notorious character like that.’\\n\\n**Fight that, my dear. Tell me a way to fight it.**\\n\\nNow you see the peculiar effectiveness of a dead issue. You can’t talk your way out of it, you can’t explain, you can’t defend yourself. Nobody wants to listen. It is difficult enough to acquire fame. **It is impossible to change its nature once you’ve acquired it.** No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that he’s a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he’s an atheist, or because somebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls wings off bottleflies. **You’ll say it doesn’t make sense? Of course it doesn’t. That’s why it works. Reason can be fought with reason. How are you going to fight the unreasonable?**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What do you think of me?\\n\\n— Mr. Roark, we’re alone here. Why don’t you tell me what you think of me?\\n \\n  \\n> But I don’t think of you.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A hater of mankind\\n\\n— I never have any definite destination. This ship is not for going to places, but for getting away from them. When I stop at a port, it’s only for the sheer pleasure of leaving it. I always think: Here’s one more spot that can’t hold me.\\n\\n— I always felt just like that. I’ve been told it’s because I’m a hater of mankind.\\n\\n— Surely you’ve seen through that particular stupidity. I mean the one that claims the creature that accepts anything is the symbol of love for humanity. As a matter of fact, **the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity can outrage him.**\\n\\n— You mean the person who says that there’s some good in the worst of us?\\n\\n— I mean the person who has the filthy insolence to claim that he loves equally the man who made that statue of you and the man who makes a Mickey Mouse balloon to sell on street corners. I mean the person who loves the men who prefer the Mickey Mouse to your statue – and there are many of that kind. […] I mean the person who loves the clean, steady, unfrightened eyes of man looking through a telescope and the white stare of an imbecile equally. […] **One can’t love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. It’s one or the other.**\\n\\n— What will you say if I give you the answer people usually give me – that love is forgiveness? Or that love is pity?\\n\\n— […] love is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don’t know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who’ve never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you’ve felt what it means to love as you and I know it you’re incapable of anything less.\\n\\n— As – you and I – know it?\\n\\n— It’s what we feel when we look at a thing like your statue. There’s no forgiveness in that, and no pity. And I’d want to kill the man who claims that there should be. **But, you see, when he looks at your statue – he feels nothing. That – or a dog with a broken paw – it’s all the same to him. He even feels that he’s done something nobler by bandaging the dog’s paw than by looking at your statue.** So if you seek a glimpse of greatness, if you want exaltation, if you ask for God and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute – you’re called a hater of humanity because you’ve committed the crime of knowing a love humanity has not learned to deserve.\\n\\n\\n### Let them come to New York\\n\\n— You’ve never felt how small you were when looking at the ocean.\\n\\n— Never. Nor looking at the planets. Nor at mountain peaks. Nor at the Grand Canyon. Why should I? When I look at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I think of man’s magnificent capacity that created this ship to conquer all that senseless space. **When I look at mountain peaks, I think of tunnels and dynamite.** When I look at the planets, I think of airplanes.\\n\\n— Yes. And that particular sense of sacred rapture men say they experience in contemplating nature – I’ve never received it from nature, only from buildings... Skyscrapers.\\n\\n— **I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York’s skyline.** Particularly when one can’t see the details. Just the shapes.

Having no power to blast the empty skulls around you? Having to take orders – and that’s bad enough – but to take orders from your inferiors! Have you felt that?\\n\\n— Yes.\\n\\n— Did you drive the anger back inside of you, and store it, and decide to let yourself be torn to pieces if necessary, but reach the day when you’d rule those people and all people and everything around you?\\n\\n— No.\\n\\n— You didn’t? You let yourself forget?\\n\\n— No. **I hate incompetence.** I think it’s probably the only thing I do hate. But it didn’t make me want to rule people. Nor to teach them anything. It made me want to do my own work in my own way and let myself be torn to pieces if necessary.\\n\\n— And you were?\\n\\n— No. Not in any way that counts.\\n\\n\\n### Selling your soul\\n\\n— If you offer me enough.\\n\\n— Anything you ask. Anything. I’d sell my soul...\\n\\n— That’s the sort of thing I want you to understand. **To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That’s what everybody does every hour of his life.** If I asked you to keep your soul – would you understand why that’s much harder?\\n\\nBut first, I want you to think and tell me what made me give years to this work. Money? Fame? Charity? Altruism? He shook his head slowly – All right. You’re beginning to understand. **So whatever we do, don’t let’s talk about the poor people in the slums. They have nothing to do with it, though I wouldn’t envy anyone the job of trying to explain that to fools.** You see, I’m never concerned with my clients, only with their architectural requirements. I consider these as part of my building’s theme and problem, as my building’s material – just as I consider bricks and steel. Bricks and steel are not my motive. Neither are the clients. Both are only the means of my work. **Before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done.** But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I’ll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that’s not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\\n\\nYou said yesterday: What architect isn’t interested in housing? I hate the whole blasted idea of it. I think it’s a worthy undertaking – to provide a decent apartment for a man who earns fifteen dollars a week. But not at the expense of other men. Not if it raises the taxes, raises all the other rents and makes the man who earns forty live in a rat hole. That’s what’s happening. **Nobody can afford a modern apartment – except the very rich and the paupers.** Have you seen the converted brownstones in which the average self-supporting couple has to live? Have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing? **They’re forced to live like that – because they’re not incompetent enough.** They make forty dollars a week and wouldn’t be allowed into a housing project. **But they’re the ones who provide the money for the damn project.** They pay the taxes. And the taxes raise their own rent. And they have to move from a converted brownstone into an unconverted one and from that into a railroad flat.\\n\\n**I’d have no desire to penalize a man because he’s worth only fifteen dollars a week. But I’ll be damned if I can see why a man worth forty must be penalized – and penalized in favor of the one who’s less competent.** Sure, there are a lot of theories on the subject and volumes of discussion. But just look at the results.\\n\\n\\n### Conceited\\n\\n— Why, no. I’m too conceited. If you want to call it that. I don’t make comparisons. I never think of myself in relation to anyone else. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything. I’m an utter egotist.\\n\\n— Yes. You are. But egotists are not kind. And you are. You’re the most egotistical and the kindest man I know. And that doesn’t make sense.\\n\\n**— Maybe the concepts don’t make sense. Maybe they don’t mean what people have been taught to think they mean.**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A trend embraced gradually\\n\\n— That’s what I want to know – what the hell? He picked up the proof and read aloud:\\n\\n> The world we have known is gone and done for and it’s no use kidding ourselves about it. **We cannot go back, we must go forward.** The mothers of today must set the example by broadening their own emotional view and raising their selfish love for their own children to a higher plane, to include everybody’s little children. Mothers must love every kid in their block, in their street, in their city, county, state, nation and the whole wide, wide world – just exactly as much as their own little Mary or Johnny.\\n \\n**It’s all right to dish out crap. But – this kind of crap?**\\n\\nHe had known for several years the trend which his paper had embraced gradually, imperceptibly, without any directive from him. He had noticed the cautious slanting of news stories, the *half-hints*, the *vague allusions*, the *peculiar adjectives peculiarly placed*, the *stressing of certain themes*, the **insertion of political conclusions where none was needed**. If a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee, the employer was made to appear guilty, simply through wording, no matter what the facts presented. If a sentence referred to the past, it was always **our dark past** or our **dead past**. If a statement involved someone’s personal motive, it was always *goaded by selfishness* or *egged by greed.* A crossword puzzle gave the definition of obsolescent individuals and the word came out as *capitalists*.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Second Handers\\n\\n— The thing that is destroying the world. The thing you were talking about. Actual selflessness.\\n\\n— The ideal which they say does not exist?\\n\\n— They’re wrong. It does exist – though not in the way they imagine. **It’s what I couldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live within others. They live second-hand.** Look at poor Peter. He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness – in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy – all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\\n\\n— **That’s the pattern most people follow.**\\n\\n— Yes! And isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. The men who place money first – what they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to entertain, to impress others. They’re second-handers. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. **A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him – and the people who listen and don’t give a damn, but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name.** All second-handers.\\n\\n— Aren’t you making out a case against selfishness? Aren’t they all acting on a selfish motive – to be noticed, liked, admired?\\n\\n— By others. At the price of their own self-respect. In the realm of greatest importance – the realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought – they place others above self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. **A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn’t need it.**\\n\\n— I think Toohey understands that. That’s what helps him spread his vicious nonsense. Just weakness and cowardice. **It’s so easy to run to others. It’s so hard to stand on one’s own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can’t fake it in your own eyes.** Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from it. They spend their lives running. It’s easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement. It’s simple to seek substitutes for competence – such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.\\n\\n— That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people. They don’t ask: *’Is this true?’* They ask: *’Is this what others think is true?’* Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. **What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists.** You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work through another’s hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation – anchored to nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand in people. That’s what stopped me whenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and you can’t reason with him. He’s not open to reason. You can’t speak to him – he can’t hear. You’re tried by an empty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose.\\n\\n— I think your second-handers understand this, try as they might not to admit it to themselves. Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognize him at once. By instinct. There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. **They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet.** The independent man kills them – because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existence they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man.\\n\\n— That’s because some sense of dignity always remains in them. They’re still human beings. But they’ve been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man can achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no self-esteem in any form. He wouldn’t survive. **So after centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted.** By seeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world perishing from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander’s delusion – prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can’t say about a single thing: *‘This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.*’ Then he wonders why he’s unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. **The things which are sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing.** To seek joy in meeting halls. We haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean – for the self-sufficiency of man’s spirit. It’s difficult to call it selfishness or egotism, the words have been perverted. **I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men.** I’ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at once – and it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Level of depravity\\n\\nBut we don’t wait to discover his reasons. We have convicted him without a hearing. We want him to be guilty. We are delighted with this case. What you hear is not indignation – it’s gloating. Any illiterate maniac, any worthless moron who commits some revolting murder, gets shrieks of sympathy from us and marshals an army of humanitarian defenders. But a man of genius is guilty by definition. **Granted that it is vicious injustice to condemn a man simply because he is weak and small. To what level of depravity has a society descended when it condemns a man simply because he is strong and great?**\\n\\n\\n### Self-sacrifice\\n\\nWe have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it. We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let’s stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man’s supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? **But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all.**\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n*...to be continued...*\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>The Fountainhead (Ayn Rand, 1943)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"atthenewjob\">At the new job</h3>\n<p>He had learned to accept his new job. The lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel beams, and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry. It was difficult, at times. Between him and the plan of the building on which he was working stood the plan of that building as it should have been. He saw what he could make of it, how to change the lines he drew, where to lead them in order to achieve a thing of splendor. <strong>He had to choke the knowledge. He had to kill the vision. He had to obey […] as instructed. It hurt him so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>But the pain remained--and a helpless wonder</strong>. The thing he saw was so much more real than the reality of paper, office and commission. <strong>He could not understand what made others blind to it</strong>, and what made their indifference possible. [...] <strong>He wondered why ineptitude should exist and have its say</strong>. He had never known that. And the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anexpertspeaksaboutarchitecture\">An expert speaks about architecture...</h3>\n<p>And thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact that we deal in nothing. We create emptiness through which certain physical bodies are to move – we shall designate them for convenience as humans. By emptiness I mean what is commonly known as rooms. Thus it is only the crass layman who thinks that we put up stone walls. We do nothing of the kind. We put up emptiness, <strong>as I have proved</strong>. This leads us to a corollary of astronomical importance: to the <strong>unconditional acceptance of the premise that ‘absence’ is superior to ‘presence’. That is, to the acceptance of non-acceptance</strong>. I shall state this in simpler terms – for the sake of clarity: <strong>’nothing’ is superior to ‘something’</strong>. Thus it is clear that the architect is more than a bricklayer – since the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion anyway. The architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to face the primal conception of reality as nonreality – since there is nothing and he creates nothingness. If this sounds like a contradiction, <strong>it is not a proof of bad logic, but of a higher logic</strong>, the dialectics of all life and art. Should you wish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic conception, <strong>you may come to conclusions of vast sociological importance. You may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to a non-beautiful one, that the literate is inferior to the illiterate, that the rich is inferior to the poor, and the able to the incompetent</strong>. The architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox. Let us be modest in the vast pride of this realization. Everything else is twaddle.</p>\n<h4 id=\"andtheresultis\">...and the result is:</h4>\n<p>The Council of American Builders met once a month and <em>engaged in no tangible activity</em>, beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer.

[…] All of it will be forgotten before Christmas.</p>\n<p>Right, my dear, everything will be forgotten by next Christmas. And that, you see, will be the achievement. <strong>You can fight a live issue. You can’t fight a dead one.</strong> Dead issues, like all dead things, don’t just vanish, but leave some decomposing matter behind. A most unpleasant thing to carry on your name. Mr. H will be thoroughly forgotten. The Temple will be forgotten. The lawsuit will be forgotten. But here’s what will remain: ‘Howard Roark? Why, how could you trust a man like that? He’s an enemy of religion. He’s completely immortal. First thing you know, he’ll gyp you on your construction costs.’ ‘Roark? He’s no good – why, a client had to sue him because he made such a botch of a building.’ ‘Roark? Wait a moment, isn’t that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of a mess? Now what was it? Some rotten kind of scandal, the owner of the building […] had to sue him. You don’t want to get involved with a notorious character like that.’</p>\n<p><strong>Fight that, my dear. Tell me a way to fight it.</strong></p>\n<p>Now you see the peculiar effectiveness of a dead issue. You can’t talk your way out of it, you can’t explain, you can’t defend yourself. Nobody wants to listen. It is difficult enough to acquire fame. <strong>It is impossible to change its nature once you’ve acquired it.</strong> No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that he’s a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he’s an atheist, or because somebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls wings off bottleflies. <strong>You’ll say it doesn’t make sense?

This ship is not for going to places, but for getting away from them. When I stop at a port, it’s only for the sheer pleasure of leaving it. I always think: Here’s one more spot that can’t hold me.</p>\n<p>— I always felt just like that. I’ve been told it’s because I’m a hater of mankind.</p>\n<p>— Surely you’ve seen through that particular stupidity. I mean the one that claims the creature that accepts anything is the symbol of love for humanity. As a matter of fact, <strong>the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity can outrage him.</strong></p>\n<p>— You mean the person who says that there’s some good in the worst of us?</p>\n<p>— I mean the person who has the filthy insolence to claim that he loves equally the man who made that statue of you and the man who makes a Mickey Mouse balloon to sell on street corners. I mean the person who loves the men who prefer the Mickey Mouse to your statue – and there are many of that kind. […] I mean the person who loves the clean, steady, unfrightened eyes of man looking through a telescope and the white stare of an imbecile equally. […] <strong>One can’t love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. It’s one or the other.</strong></p>\n<p>— What will you say if I give you the answer people usually give me – that love is forgiveness? Or that love is pity?</p>\n<p>— […] love is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don’t know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who’ve never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you’ve felt what it means to love as you and I know it you’re incapable of anything less.</p>\n<p>— As – you and I – know it?</p>\n<p>— It’s what we feel when we look at a thing like your statue. There’s no forgiveness in that, and no pity. And I’d want to kill the man who claims that there should be. <strong>But, you see, when he looks at your statue – he feels nothing. That – or a dog with a broken paw – it’s all the same to him. He even feels that he’s done something nobler by bandaging the dog’s paw than by looking at your statue.</strong> So if you seek a glimpse of greatness, if you want exaltation, if you ask for God and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute – you’re called a hater of humanity because you’ve committed the crime of knowing a love humanity has not learned to deserve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"letthemcometonewyork\">Let them come to New York</h3>\n<p>— You’ve never felt how small you were when looking at the ocean.</p>\n<p>— Never. Nor looking at the planets. Nor at mountain peaks. Nor at the Grand Canyon. Why should I?

The thing you were talking about. Actual selflessness.</p>\n<p>— The ideal which they say does not exist?</p>\n<p>— They’re wrong. It does exist – though not in the way they imagine. <strong>It’s what I couldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live within others. They live second-hand.</strong> Look at poor Peter. He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness – in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy – all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.</p>\n<p>— <strong>That’s the pattern most people follow.</strong></p>\n<p>— Yes! And isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. The men who place money first – what they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to entertain, to impress others. They’re second-handers. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. <strong>A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him – and the people who listen and don’t give a damn, but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name.</strong> All second-handers.</p>\n<p>— Aren’t you making out a case against selfishness? Aren’t they all acting on a selfish motive – to be noticed, liked, admired?</p>\n<p>— By others. At the price of their own self-respect. In the realm of greatest importance – the realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought – they place others above self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. <strong>A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn’t need it.</strong></p>\n<p>— I think Toohey understands that. That’s what helps him spread his vicious nonsense. Just weakness and cowardice. <strong>It’s so easy to run to others. It’s so hard to stand on one’s own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can’t fake it in your own eyes.</strong> Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from it. They spend their lives running. It’s easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement. It’s simple to seek substitutes for competence – such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.</p>\n<p>— That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people. They don’t ask: <em>’Is this true?’</em> They ask: <em>’Is this what others think is true?’</em> Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. <strong>What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists.</strong> You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work through another’s hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation – anchored to nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand in people. That’s what stopped me whenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and you can’t reason with him. He’s not open to reason. You can’t speak to him – he can’t hear. You’re tried by an empty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose.</p>\n<p>— I think your second-handers understand this, try as they might not to admit it to themselves. Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognize him at once. By instinct. There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. <strong>They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet.</strong> The independent man kills them – because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existence they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man.</p>\n<p>— That’s because some sense of dignity always remains in them. They’re still human beings. But they’ve been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man can achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no self-esteem in any form. He wouldn’t survive. <strong>So after centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted.</strong> By seeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world perishing from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander’s delusion – prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can’t say about a single thing: <em>‘This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.</em>’ Then he wonders why he’s unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. <strong>The things which are sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing.</strong> To seek joy in meeting halls. We haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean – for the self-sufficiency of man’s spirit. It’s difficult to call it selfishness or egotism, the words have been perverted. <strong>I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men.</strong> I’ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at once – and it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"levelofdepravity\">Level of depravity</h3>\n<p>But we don’t wait to discover his reasons. We have convicted him without a hearing. We want him to be guilty. We are delighted with this case. What you hear is not indignation – it’s gloating. Any illiterate maniac, any worthless moron who commits some revolting murder, gets shrieks of sympathy from us and marshals an army of humanitarian defenders. But a man of genius is guilty by definition. <strong>Granted that it is vicious injustice to condemn a man simply because he is weak and small. To what level of depravity has a society descended when it condemns a man simply because he is strong and great?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"selfsacrifice\">Self-sacrifice</h3>\n<p>We have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it. We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let’s stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man’s supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? <strong>But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>...to be continued...</em></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"8","plaintext":"The Fountainhead (Ayn Rand, 1943)\n\n\nAt the new job\nHe had learned to accept his new job. The lines he drew were to be the clean\nlines of steel beams, and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry.\nIt was difficult, at times. Between him and the plan of the building on which he\nwas working stood the plan of that building as it should have been. He saw what\nhe could make of it, how to change the lines he drew, where to lead them in\norder to achieve a thing of splendor. He had to choke the knowledge. He had to\nkill the vision. He had to obey […] as instructed. It hurt him so much that he\nshrugged at himself in cold anger.\n\nBut the pain remained--and a helpless wonder. The thing he saw was so much more\nreal than the reality of paper, office and commission. He could not understand\nwhat made others blind to it, and what made their indifference possible. [...] \nHe wondered why ineptitude should exist and have its say. He had never known\nthat. And the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him.\n\nAn expert speaks about architecture...\nAnd thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact\nthat we deal in nothing. We create emptiness through which certain physical\nbodies are to move – we shall designate them for convenience as humans. By\nemptiness I mean what is commonly known as rooms. Thus it is only the crass\nlayman who thinks that we put up stone walls. We do nothing of the kind. We put\nup emptiness, as I have proved. This leads us to a corollary of astronomical\nimportance: to the unconditional acceptance of the premise that ‘absence’ is\nsuperior to ‘presence’. That is, to the acceptance of non-acceptance. I shall\nstate this in simpler terms – for the sake of clarity: ’nothing’ is superior to\n‘something’. Thus it is clear that the architect is more than a bricklayer –\nsince the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion anyway. The architect is a\nmetaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials, who has the courage to face the\nprimal conception of reality as nonreality – since there is nothing and he\ncreates nothingness. If this sounds like a contradiction, it is not a proof of\nbad logic, but of a higher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. Should you\nwish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic conception, you may come\nto conclusions of vast sociological importance. You may see that a beautiful\nwoman is inferior to a non-beautiful one, that the literate is inferior to the\nilliterate, that the rich is inferior to the poor, and the able to the\nincompetent. The architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox. Let\nus be modest in the vast pride of this realization. Everything else is twaddle.\n\n...and the result is:\nThe Council of American Builders met once a month and engaged in no tangible\nactivity, beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root\nbeer. Its membership did not grow fast either in quantity or in quality. There\nwere no concrete results achieved.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA dead issue\nIt will prove nothing, whether he wins or loses. […] All of it will be forgotten\nbefore Christmas.\n\nRight, my dear, everything will be forgotten by next Christmas. And that, you\nsee, will be the achievement. You can fight a live issue. You can’t fight a dead\none. Dead issues, like all dead things, don’t just vanish, but leave some\ndecomposing matter behind. A most unpleasant thing to carry on your name. Mr. H\nwill be thoroughly forgotten. The Temple will be forgotten. The lawsuit will be\nforgotten. But here’s what will remain: ‘Howard Roark? Why, how could you trust\na man like that? He’s an enemy of religion. He’s completely immortal. First\nthing you know, he’ll gyp you on your construction costs.’ ‘Roark? He’s no good\n– why, a client had to sue him because he made such a botch of a building.’\n‘Roark? Wait a moment, isn’t that the guy who got into all the papers over some\nsort of a mess? Now what was it? Some rotten kind of scandal, the owner of the\nbuilding […] had to sue him. You don’t want to get involved with a notorious\ncharacter like that.’\n\nFight that, my dear. Tell me a way to fight it.\n\nNow you see the peculiar effectiveness of a dead issue. You can’t talk your way\nout of it, you can’t explain, you can’t defend yourself. Nobody wants to listen.\nIt is difficult enough to acquire fame. It is impossible to change its nature\nonce you’ve acquired it. No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that\nhe’s a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he’s an atheist, or because\nsomebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls\nwings off bottleflies. You’ll say it doesn’t make sense? Of course it doesn’t.\nThat’s why it works. Reason can be fought with reason. How are you going to\nfight the unreasonable?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat do you think of me?\n— Mr. Roark, we’re alone here. Why don’t you tell me what you think of me?\n\n> But I don’t think of you.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA hater of mankind\n— I never have any definite destination. This ship is not for going to places,\nbut for getting away from them. When I stop at a port, it’s only for the sheer\npleasure of leaving it. I always think: Here’s one more spot that can’t hold me.\n\n— I always felt just like that. I’ve been told it’s because I’m a hater of\nmankind.\n\n— Surely you’ve seen through that particular stupidity. I mean the one that\nclaims the creature that accepts anything is the symbol of love for humanity. As\na matter of fact, the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is\nthe true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity\ncan outrage him.\n\n— You mean the person who says that there’s some good in the worst of us?\n\n— I mean the person who has the filthy insolence to claim that he loves equally\nthe man who made that statue of you and the man who makes a Mickey Mouse balloon\nto sell on street corners. I mean the person who loves the men who prefer the\nMickey Mouse to your statue – and there are many of that kind. […] I mean the\nperson who loves the clean, steady, unfrightened eyes of man looking through a\ntelescope and the white stare of an imbecile equally. […] One can’t love man\nwithout hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name. It’s one or\nthe other.\n\n— What will you say if I give you the answer people usually give me – that love\nis forgiveness? Or that love is pity?\n\n— […] love is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a\nbandage for dirty sores. But they don’t know it. Those who speak of love most\npromiscuously are the ones who’ve never felt it. They make some sort of feeble\nstew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they\ncall it love. Once you’ve felt what it means to love as you and I know it you’re\nincapable of anything less.\n\n— As – you and I – know it?\n\n— It’s what we feel when we look at a thing like your statue. There’s no\nforgiveness in that, and no pity. And I’d want to kill the man who claims that\nthere should be. But, you see, when he looks at your statue – he feels nothing.\nThat – or a dog with a broken paw – it’s all the same to him. He even feels that\nhe’s done something nobler by bandaging the dog’s paw than by looking at your\nstatue. So if you seek a glimpse of greatness, if you want exaltation, if you\nask for God and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute – you’re\ncalled a hater of humanity because you’ve committed the crime of knowing a love\nhumanity has not learned to deserve.\n\nLet them come to New York\n— You’ve never felt how small you were when looking at the ocean.\n\n— Never. Nor looking at the planets. Nor at mountain peaks. Nor at the Grand\nCanyon. Why should I? When I look at the ocean, I feel the greatness of man, I\nthink of man’s magnificent capacity that created this ship to conquer all that\nsenseless space. When I look at mountain peaks, I think of tunnels and dynamite. \nWhen I look at the planets, I think of airplanes.\n\n— Yes. And that particular sense of sacred rapture men say they experience in\ncontemplating nature – I’ve never received it from nature, only from\nbuildings... Skyscrapers.\n\n— I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York’s\nskyline. Particularly when one can’t see the details. Just the shapes. The\nshapes and the thought that made them. The sky over New York and the will of man\nmade visible. What other religion do we need? And then people tell me about\npilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a\ncrumbling temple, to a leering stone monster with a pot belly, created by some\nleprous savage. Is it beauty and genius they want to see? Do they seek a sense\nof the sublime?\n\nLet them come to New York, stand on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel.\n\nIt’s interesting to speculate on the reasons that make men so anxious to debase\nthemselves. As in that idea of feeling small before nature. It’s not a bromide,\nit’s practically an institution. Have you noticed how self-righteous a man\nsounds when he tells you about it? Look, he seems to say, I’m so glad to be a\npygmy, that’s how virtuous I am. […] But that’s not the spirit that leashed\nfire, steam, electricity, that crossed oceans in sailing sloops, that built\nairplanes and dams...and skyscrapers. What is it they fear? What is they hate so\nmuch, those who love to crawl? And why?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing I hate\n— Did you want to scream, when you were a child, seeing nothing but fat\nineptitude around you, knowing how many things could be done and done so well,\nbut having no power to do them? Having no power to blast the empty skulls around\nyou? Having to take orders – and that’s bad enough – but to take orders from\nyour inferiors! Have you felt that?\n\n— Yes.\n\n— Did you drive the anger back inside of you, and store it, and decide to let\nyourself be torn to pieces if necessary, but reach the day when you’d rule those\npeople and all people and everything around you?\n\n— No.\n\n— You didn’t? You let yourself forget?\n\n— No. I hate incompetence. I think it’s probably the only thing I do hate. But\nit didn’t make me want to rule people. Nor to teach them anything. It made me\nwant to do my own work in my own way and let myself be torn to pieces if\nnecessary.\n\n— And you were?\n\n— No. Not in any way that counts.\n\nSelling your soul\n— If you offer me enough.\n\n— Anything you ask. Anything. I’d sell my soul...\n\n— That’s the sort of thing I want you to understand. To sell your soul is the\neasiest thing in the world. That’s what everybody does every hour of his life. \nIf I asked you to keep your soul – would you understand why that’s much harder?\n\nBut first, I want you to think and tell me what made me give years to this work.\nMoney? Fame? Charity? Altruism? He shook his head slowly – All right. You’re\nbeginning to understand. So whatever we do, don’t let’s talk about the poor\npeople in the slums. They have nothing to do with it, though I wouldn’t envy\nanyone the job of trying to explain that to fools. You see, I’m never concerned\nwith my clients, only with their architectural requirements. I consider these as\npart of my building’s theme and problem, as my building’s material – just as I\nconsider bricks and steel. Bricks and steel are not my motive. Neither are the\nclients. Both are only the means of my work. Before you can do things for\npeople, you must be the kind of man who can get things done. But to get things\ndone, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the\npeople. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I’ll be glad\nif people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But\nthat’s not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\n\nYou said yesterday: What architect isn’t interested in housing? I hate the whole\nblasted idea of it. I think it’s a worthy undertaking – to provide a decent\napartment for a man who earns fifteen dollars a week. But not at the expense of\nother men. Not if it raises the taxes, raises all the other rents and makes the\nman who earns forty live in a rat hole. That’s what’s happening. Nobody can\nafford a modern apartment – except the very rich and the paupers. Have you seen\nthe converted brownstones in which the average self-supporting couple has to\nlive? Have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing? They’re forced to\nlive like that – because they’re not incompetent enough. They make forty dollars\na week and wouldn’t be allowed into a housing project. But they’re the ones who\nprovide the money for the damn project. They pay the taxes. And the taxes raise\ntheir own rent. And they have to move from a converted brownstone into an\nunconverted one and from that into a railroad flat.\n\nI’d have no desire to penalize a man because he’s worth only fifteen dollars a\nweek. But I’ll be damned if I can see why a man worth forty must be penalized –\nand penalized in favor of the one who’s less competent. Sure, there are a lot of\ntheories on the subject and volumes of discussion. But just look at the results.\n\nConceited\n— Why, no. I’m too conceited. If you want to call it that. I don’t make\ncomparisons. I never think of myself in relation to anyone else. I just refuse\nto measure myself as part of anything. I’m an utter egotist.\n\n— Yes. You are. But egotists are not kind. And you are. You’re the most\negotistical and the kindest man I know. And that doesn’t make sense.\n\n— Maybe the concepts don’t make sense. Maybe they don’t mean what people have\nbeen taught to think they mean.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA trend embraced gradually\n— That’s what I want to know – what the hell? He picked up the proof and read\naloud:\n\n> The world we have known is gone and done for and it’s no use kidding ourselves\nabout it. We cannot go back, we must go forward. The mothers of today must set\nthe example by broadening their own emotional view and raising their selfish\nlove for their own children to a higher plane, to include everybody’s little\nchildren. Mothers must love every kid in their block, in their street, in their\ncity, county, state, nation and the whole wide, wide world – just exactly as\nmuch as their own little Mary or Johnny.\n\n\nIt’s all right to dish out crap. But – this kind of crap?\n\nHe had known for several years the trend which his paper had embraced gradually,\nimperceptibly, without any directive from him. He had noticed the cautious\nslanting of news stories, the half-hints, the vague allusions, the peculiar\nadjectives peculiarly placed, the stressing of certain themes, the insertion of\npolitical conclusions where none was needed. If a story concerned a dispute\nbetween employer and employee, the employer was made to appear guilty, simply\nthrough wording, no matter what the facts presented. If a sentence referred to\nthe past, it was always our dark past or our dead past. If a statement involved\nsomeone’s personal motive, it was always goaded by selfishness or egged by\ngreed. A crossword puzzle gave the definition of obsolescent individuals and the\nword came out as capitalists.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSecond Handers\n— The thing that is destroying the world. The thing you were talking about.\nActual selflessness.\n\n— The ideal which they say does not exist?\n\n— They’re wrong. It does exist – though not in the way they imagine. It’s what I\ncouldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live\nwithin others. They live second-hand. Look at poor Peter. He’s paying the price\nand wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In\nwhat act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life?\nGreatness – in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy – all that which\ncomes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but\nhe was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power\nand his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He\ndidn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in\norder to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s\nhis ego he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\n\n— That’s the pattern most people follow.\n\n— Yes! And isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but\nprecisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but\npreserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others\nthink he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The\nman who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself\nto be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who\nprofesses love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to\nestablish his own superiority by comparison. The men who place money first –\nwhat they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to entertain, to impress\nothers. They’re second-handers. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. A\nlecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at\nall to him – and the people who listen and don’t give a damn, but sit there in\norder to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name. \nAll second-handers.\n\n— Aren’t you making out a case against selfishness? Aren’t they all acting on a\nselfish motive – to be noticed, liked, admired?\n\n— By others. At the price of their own self-respect. In the realm of greatest\nimportance – the realm of values, of judgment, of spirit, of thought – they\nplace others above self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. A truly\nselfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn’t need it.\n\n— I think Toohey understands that. That’s what helps him spread his vicious\nnonsense. Just weakness and cowardice. It’s so easy to run to others. It’s so\nhard to stand on one’s own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You\ncan’t fake it in your own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from\nit. They spend their lives running. It’s easier to donate a few thousand to\ncharity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards\nof personal achievement. It’s simple to seek substitutes for competence – such\neasy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for\ncompetence.\n\n— That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for\nfacts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people. They don’t ask: ’Is this\ntrue?’ They ask: ’Is this what others think is true?’ Not to judge, but to\nrepeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show.\nNot ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world\nwithout those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You don’t\nthink through another’s brain and you don’t work through another’s hands. When\nyou suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To\nstop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality.\nTheir reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one\nhuman body from another. Not an entity, but a relation – anchored to nothing.\nThat’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand in people. That’s what stopped me\nwhenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational\nprocess. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The\nsecond-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other\nliving person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and you can’t reason with him. He’s\nnot open to reason. You can’t speak to him – he can’t hear. You’re tried by an\nempty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose.\n\n— I think your second-handers understand this, try as they might not to admit it\nto themselves. Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone.\nThey recognize him at once. By instinct. There’s a special, insidious kind of\nhatred for him. They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and\nviolence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to\nforce their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet. The\nindependent man kills them – because they don’t exist within him and that’s the\nonly form of existence they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment\nagainst any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an\nindependent man.\n\n— That’s because some sense of dignity always remains in them. They’re still\nhuman beings. But they’ve been taught to seek themselves in others. Yet no man\ncan achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no self-esteem in any\nform. He wouldn’t survive. So after centuries of being pounded with the doctrine\nthat altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it\ncould be accepted. By seeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand.\nAnd it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful\nform of selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now,\nto cure a world perishing from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self.\nListen to what is being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve\nwondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man\nstopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d\nfind the answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his\nambitions are motivated by other men. He’s not really struggling even for\nmaterial wealth, but for the second-hander’s delusion – prestige. A stamp of\napproval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has\nsucceeded. He can’t say about a single thing: ‘This is what I wanted because I\nwanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.’ Then he wonders why\nhe’s unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are\npersonal, self-motivated, not to be touched. The things which are sacred or\nprecious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we\nare taught to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing. To\nseek joy in meeting halls. We haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean –\nfor the self-sufficiency of man’s spirit. It’s difficult to call it selfishness\nor egotism, the words have been perverted. I think the only cardinal evil on\nearth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. I’ve always\ndemanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at\nonce – and it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that.\nNow I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLevel of depravity\nBut we don’t wait to discover his reasons. We have convicted him without a\nhearing. We want him to be guilty. We are delighted with this case. What you\nhear is not indignation – it’s gloating. Any illiterate maniac, any worthless\nmoron who commits some revolting murder, gets shrieks of sympathy from us and\nmarshals an army of humanitarian defenders. But a man of genius is guilty by\ndefinition. Granted that it is vicious injustice to condemn a man simply because\nhe is weak and small. To what level of depravity has a society descended when it\ncondemns a man simply because he is strong and great?\n\nSelf-sacrifice\nWe have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to\nrecognize it. We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness\nis to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate\nvirtue. Let’s stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man\nsacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The\nhonesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man’s\nsupreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an\neasy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration\nwhatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense?\nSelf-sacrifice? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be\nsacrificed. It is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n...to be continued...","feature_image":"/content/images/2015/09/007-the-fountainhead-theredlist.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2015-02-23 02:08:46","updated_at":"2017-05-02 19:56:08","published_at":"2015-04-23 18:06:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5baa33d40283b4635b8c9859","uuid":"cbb7eb95-d96a-4307-9426-c44b14b384c1","title":"Peace and the Borgias","slug":"untitled-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"> In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had *warfare*, *terror*, *murder*, *bloodshed*, but they produced *Michelangelo*, Leonardo *da Vinci* and **the Renaissance**.\\n\\n> In Switzerland, they had *brotherly love* – they had five hundred years of *democracy* and *peace*, and what did that produce?

The impossible perfect, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind’s great schools of thought. You harnessed him. You made him work for you. You took his achievement, his reward, his money, his glory, his name. We only thought and wrote about it. You gave a practical demonstration. Every philosopher from Plato up should thank you. Here it is, the philosopher’s stone – for turning gold into lead. I should be pleased, but I guess I’m human and I can’t help it, I’m not pleased, I’m just sick. The others, Plato and all the rest, they really thought it would turn lead into gold. I knew the truth from the first. __I’ve been honest with myself, Peter, and that’s the hardest form of honesty. The one you all run from at any price.__ And right now I don’t blame you, it is the hardest one, Peter.\\n\\nYou make me sick. God, how you make me sick, all you hypocritical sentimentalists! __You go along with me, you spout what I teach you, you profit by it – but you haven’t the grace to admit to yourself what you’re doing.__ You turn green when you see the truth. I suppose that’s in the nature of your natures and that’s precisely my chief weapon – but God! I get tired of it. I must allow myself a moment free of you. That’s what I have to put on an act for all my life – for mean little mediocrities like you. To protect your sensibilities, your posturings, your conscience and the peace of the mind you haven’t got. __That’s the price I pay for what I want – but at least I know that I’ve got to pay it. And I have no illusions about the price or the purchase.__\\n\\nI’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. __It’s not my fault if you couldn’t hear. You could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer than deafness – for me. I said I intended to rule. Like all my spiritual predecessors.__ But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule.\\n\\n— Whom...?\\n\\nYou. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. __If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, the soul.__ Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. __The soul, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped.__ Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine. \\n\\nThere are many ways. Here’s one.\\n\\n###### Make man feel small.\\nMake him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructive of all integrity. __Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will.__ His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue – and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? __His soul gives up its self-respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey.__ He’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way.\\n\\nHere’s another.\\n\\n###### Kill man’s sense of values.\\n__Kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled.__ We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. __Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept – and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection.__\\n\\nLaugh at the great and hold the mediocre as a great architect. You’ve destroyed architecture. Build up [some morrow] and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail [other morrow] and you’ve destroyed the theater. Glorify [third morrow] and you’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten men. __Enshrine mediocrity – and the shrines are razed.__\\n\\nHere’s another way. This is most important.\\n\\n###### Don’t allow men to be happy.\\nHappiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. __Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living.__ Take away from them whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. __Bring them to a state where saying I want’ is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this.__ Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so shocked. __This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy?__ Under all the complications of verbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song – _’Give up, give up, give up, give up’_? __Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy – and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat.__ Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails – go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don’t go to the movies on Sunday – don’t try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned.\\n\\n__But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly – ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men.__ Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don’t have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words.\\n\\n- _Universal Harmony_\\n- _Eternal Spirit_\\n- _Divine Purpose_\\n- _Nirvana_\\n- _Paradise_\\n- __Racial Supremacy__\\n- __The Dictatorship of the Proletariat__\\n \\nInternal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. __Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run. Run faster than from a plague.__ It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone being served.\\n\\n==__The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master.__==\\n\\nBut if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who’s not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. _But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster._ __So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.__ But here you might have noticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? __Men have a weapon against you.__\\n\\n###### Reason.\\n__So you must be very sure to take it away from them.__ Cut the props from under it. But be careful. Don’t deny outright. __Never deny anything outright, you give your hand away.__ Don’t say reason is evil – though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. __Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above it. What? You don’t have to be too clear about it either.__ The field’s inexhaustible.\\n\\n- _Instinct_ \\n- _Feeling_\\n- _Revelation_\\n- _Divine Intuition_\\n- _Dialectic Materialism_\\n\\nIf you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn’t make sense – you’re ready for him. __You tell him that there’s something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild.__ Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. __Can you rule a thinking man? We don’t want any thinking men.__\\n\\n\\n### ...and the World of the Future\\n\\nThe world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. __A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought of the brain of his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought__ – and so on around the globe. __Since all must agree with all.__ A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who’ll have no desires – around the globe. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows – their good opinion – __the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain.__ \\n\\nJudgment! Not judgment, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeroes – since no individuality will be permitted. A world with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men like me. __Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve liked and accepted those names.__ You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general. Do you know the proper antonym for Ego? Bromide. The rule of the bromide. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited submission – from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it ‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no other distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement.\\n\\nNow if you were a little more intelligent you’d ask: What of us, the rulers? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. __I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good.__ Peter, my poor old friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve every known. I have less independence than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I want nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them. It’s my only function and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. __I want power. I want my world of the future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery – without even the dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle – and a total equality.__ The world of the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### But then, unite and rule\\n\\nInsane? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it coming? Isn’t it here? Every single thing I told you? Everything I said is contained in a single word – __collectivism__. And isn’t that the god of our century? To act together. To think – together. To feel – together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. __Divide and conquer – first. But then – unite and rule.__ We’ve discovered that one at last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. __We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism.__ Look at Europe, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence?\\n\\nOne country is dedicated to the proposition that __man has no rights, that the collective is all__. The individual held as evil, the mass – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat. That’s one version. Here’s another.\\n\\nA country dedicated to the proposition that __man has no rights, that the State is all__. The individual held as evil, the race – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the race.\\n\\nIf you’re sick of one version, we push you into the other. We get you coming and going. We’ve closed the doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism, and tails – collectivism. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council – or give it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique, Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. __Give the fools a choice, let them have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically.__ Observe the state of the world as of the present moment. Do you still think I’m crazy?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n### Against the men of their time\\n\\nThroughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received – hatred. __The great creators – the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors – stood alone against the men of their time.__\\n\\n__Every great new thought was opposed.__\\n\\n__Every great new invention was denounced.__\\n\\nThe first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. __They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.__\\n\\n\\n### The individual mind\\n\\nBut the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. __The primary act – the process of reason – must be performed by each man alone.__ We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.\\n\\nWe inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. We make a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end product of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. __This creative faculty cannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual men.__ That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can give another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of survival.\\n\\n\\n### Altruism\\n\\nThe basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.\\n\\nThe basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self.\\n\\n__No man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share his body.__ But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation and reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been taught every precept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence as a virtue.\\n\\nThe man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality – the man who lives to serve others – is the slave. If physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit? The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resisted and of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence of altruism.\\n\\n__Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution – or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary.__\\n\\n__Yet we are taught to admire the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who made the gifts possible.__\\n\\n__We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement.__\\n\\n\\n\\n### The greatest fraud\\n\\nMen have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. __But the creator is the man who disagrees.__ Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. __But the creator is the man who goes against the current.__ Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. __But the creator is the man who stands alone.__\\n\\nMen have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. __But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act.__ These are functions of the self.\\n\\nHere the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man has been left no alternative – and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was offered two conceptions: egotism and altruism. Egotism was held to mean the sacrifice of others to self. Altruism – the sacrifice of self to others. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was closed. __Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal – under the threat that sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind.__\\n\\nThis was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as fundamentals of life. The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. __The choice is independence or dependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This is the basic issue.__\\n\\n### Personal dignity\\n\\nDegrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man’s independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. __What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity.__ There is no standard of personal dignity except independence.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Destroying the creators\\n\\n__The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to himself.__ His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator.\\n\\nA man thinks and works alone. __A man cannot rob, exploit or rule – alone. Robbery, exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are the province of the second-hander.__\\n\\n__Rulers of men are not egotists. They create nothing. They exist entirely through the persons of others.__ Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of enslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and the bandit. The form of dependence does not matter.\\n\\n__==But men were taught to regard second-handers – tyrants, emperors, dictators – as exponents of egotism.== By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego, themselves and others.__ The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or to harness them. Which is a synonym.\\n\\n\\n### Observe the results\\n\\nFrom the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the first second-hander responded. He invented altruism.\\n\\n__The creator – denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited – went on, moved forward and carried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed nothing to the process except the impediments.__ The contest has another name: the individual against the collective.\\n\\n__The ‘common good’ of a collective – a race, a class, a state – was the claim and justification of every tyranny ever established over men.__\\n\\n__Every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive.__ Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism? Does the fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle?\\n\\n__The most dreadful butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect society reached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned their right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose.__ It was accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men.\\n\\nActors change, but the course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts with declarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood. __It goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish.__ That permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leaders of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Civilization\\n\\nIt is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. __Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy.__ The savage’s whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. __Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.__\\n\\n__Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater, the ancient monster, has broken loose and is running amuck.__ It has brought men to a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth. It has reached a scale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind.\\n\\nI know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>The Fountainhead (Ayn Rand, 1943)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"howtorulemen\">How to rule men</h3>\n<p>You had to do it. <strong>Who are you to reverse the laws of history?</strong> Do you know what this paper is? The impossible perfect, the dream of the centuries, the aim of all of mankind’s great schools of thought. You harnessed him. You made him work for you. You took his achievement, his reward, his money, his glory, his name. We only thought and wrote about it. You gave a practical demonstration. Every philosopher from Plato up should thank you. Here it is, the philosopher’s stone – for turning gold into lead. I should be pleased, but I guess I’m human and I can’t help it, I’m not pleased, I’m just sick. The others, Plato and all the rest, they really thought it would turn lead into gold. I knew the truth from the first. <strong>I’ve been honest with myself, Peter, and that’s the hardest form of honesty. The one you all run from at any price.</strong> And right now I don’t blame you, it is the hardest one, Peter.</p>\n<p>You make me sick. God, how you make me sick, all you hypocritical sentimentalists! <strong>You go along with me, you spout what I teach you, you profit by it – but you haven’t the grace to admit to yourself what you’re doing.</strong> You turn green when you see the truth. I suppose that’s in the nature of your natures and that’s precisely my chief weapon – but God! I get tired of it. I must allow myself a moment free of you. That’s what I have to put on an act for all my life – for mean little mediocrities like you. To protect your sensibilities, your posturings, your conscience and the peace of the mind you haven’t got. <strong>That’s the price I pay for what I want – but at least I know that I’ve got to pay it. And I have no illusions about the price or the purchase.</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. <strong>It’s not my fault if you couldn’t hear. You could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer than deafness – for me. I said I intended to rule. Like all my spiritual predecessors.</strong> But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule.</p>\n<p>— Whom...?</p>\n<p>You. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. <strong>If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, the soul.</strong> Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. <strong>The soul, is that which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped.</strong> Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine.</p>\n<p>There are many ways. Here’s one.</p>\n<h6 id=\"makemanfeelsmall\">Make man feel small.</h6>\n<p>Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructive of all integrity. <strong>Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will.</strong> His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue – and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? <strong>His soul gives up its self-respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey.</strong> He’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way.</p>\n<p>Here’s another.</p>\n<h6 id=\"killmanssenseofvalues\">Kill man’s sense of values.</h6>\n<p><strong>Kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled.</strong> We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. <strong>Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept – and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection.</strong></p>\n<p>Laugh at the great and hold the mediocre as a great architect. You’ve destroyed architecture. Build up [some morrow] and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail [other morrow] and you’ve destroyed the theater. Glorify [third morrow] and you’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten men. <strong>Enshrine mediocrity – and the shrines are razed.</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s another way. This is most important.</p>\n<h6 id=\"dontallowmentobehappy\">Don’t allow men to be happy.</h6>\n<p>Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. <strong>Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living.</strong> Take away from them whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. <strong>Bring them to a state where saying I want’ is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this.</strong> Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so shocked. <strong>This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy?</strong> Under all the complications of verbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven’t you been able to catch their theme song – <em>’Give up, give up, give up, give up’</em>? <strong>Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy – and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat.</strong> Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails – go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don’t go to the movies on Sunday – don’t try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned.</p>\n<p><strong>But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly – ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men.</strong> Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don’t have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Universal Harmony</em></li>\n<li><em>Eternal Spirit</em></li>\n<li><em>Divine Purpose</em></li>\n<li><em>Nirvana</em></li>\n<li><em>Paradise</em></li>\n<li><strong>Racial Supremacy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. <strong>Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run. Run faster than from a plague.</strong> It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone being served.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master.</strong></mark></p>\n<p>But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who’s not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. <em>But let him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster.</em> <strong>So the racket is safe for many, many centuries.</strong> But here you might have noticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? <strong>Men have a weapon against you.</strong></p>\n<h6 id=\"reason\">Reason.</h6>\n<p><strong>So you must be very sure to take it away from them.</strong> Cut the props from under it. But be careful. Don’t deny outright. <strong>Never deny anything outright, you give your hand away.</strong> Don’t say reason is evil – though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. <strong>Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above it. What? You don’t have to be too clear about it either.</strong> The field’s inexhaustible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Instinct</em></li>\n<li><em>Feeling</em></li>\n<li><em>Revelation</em></li>\n<li><em>Divine Intuition</em></li>\n<li><em>Dialectic Materialism</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn’t make sense – you’re ready for him. <strong>You tell him that there’s something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild.</strong> Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. <strong>Can you rule a thinking man? We don’t want any thinking men.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"andtheworldofthefuture\">...and the World of the Future</h3>\n<p>The world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. <strong>A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought of the brain of his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought</strong> – and so on around the globe. <strong>Since all must agree with all.</strong> A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who’ll have no desires – around the globe. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows – their good opinion – <strong>the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain.</strong></p>\n<p>Judgment! Not judgment, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeroes – since no individuality will be permitted. A world with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men like me. <strong>Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve liked and accepted those names.</strong> You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general. Do you know the proper antonym for Ego? Bromide. The rule of the bromide. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited submission – from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it ‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no other distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement.</p>\n<p>Now if you were a little more intelligent you’d ask: What of us, the rulers? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. <strong>I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good.</strong> Peter, my poor old friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve every known. I have less independence than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I want nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them. It’s my only function and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. <strong>I want power. I want my world of the future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery – without even the dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle – and a total equality.</strong> The world of the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"butthenuniteandrule\">But then, unite and rule</h3>\n<p>Insane? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it coming? Isn’t it here? Every single thing I told you? Everything I said is contained in a single word – <strong>collectivism</strong>. And isn’t that the god of our century? To act together. To think – together. To feel – together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. <strong>Divide and conquer – first. But then – unite and rule.</strong> We’ve discovered that one at last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. <strong>We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism.</strong> Look at Europe, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence?</p>\n<p>One country is dedicated to the proposition that <strong>man has no rights, that the collective is all</strong>. The individual held as evil, the mass – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat. That’s one version. Here’s another.</p>\n<p>A country dedicated to the proposition that <strong>man has no rights, that the State is all</strong>. The individual held as evil, the race – as God. No motive and no virtue permitted – except that of service to the race.</p>\n<p>If you’re sick of one version, we push you into the other. We get you coming and going. We’ve closed the doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism, and tails – collectivism. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council – or give it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique, Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. <strong>Give the fools a choice, let them have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically.</strong> Observe the state of the world as of the present moment. Do you still think I’m crazy?</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"againstthemenoftheirtime\">Against the men of their time</h3>\n<p>Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received – hatred. <strong>The great creators – the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors – stood alone against the men of their time.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Every great new thought was opposed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Every great new invention was denounced.</strong></p>\n<p>The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. <strong>They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"theindividualmind\">The individual mind</h3>\n<p>But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. <strong>The primary act – the process of reason – must be performed by each man alone.</strong> We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.</p>\n<p>We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. We make a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end product of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. <strong>This creative faculty cannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual men.</strong> That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can give another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of survival.</p>\n<h3 id=\"altruism\">Altruism</h3>\n<p>The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.</p>\n<p>The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places relations first.

Who are you to reverse the laws of history? Do you know what\nthis paper is? The impossible perfect, the dream of the centuries, the aim of\nall of mankind’s great schools of thought. You harnessed him. You made him work\nfor you. You took his achievement, his reward, his money, his glory, his name.\nWe only thought and wrote about it. You gave a practical demonstration. Every\nphilosopher from Plato up should thank you. Here it is, the philosopher’s stone\n– for turning gold into lead. I should be pleased, but I guess I’m human and I\ncan’t help it, I’m not pleased, I’m just sick. The others, Plato and all the\nrest, they really thought it would turn lead into gold. I knew the truth from\nthe first. I’ve been honest with myself, Peter, and that’s the hardest form of\nhonesty. The one you all run from at any price. And right now I don’t blame you,\nit is the hardest one, Peter.\n\nYou make me sick. God, how you make me sick, all you hypocritical\nsentimentalists! You go along with me, you spout what I teach you, you profit by\nit – but you haven’t the grace to admit to yourself what you’re doing. You turn\ngreen when you see the truth. I suppose that’s in the nature of your natures and\nthat’s precisely my chief weapon – but God! I get tired of it. I must allow\nmyself a moment free of you. That’s what I have to put on an act for all my life\n– for mean little mediocrities like you. To protect your sensibilities, your\nposturings, your conscience and the peace of the mind you haven’t got. That’s\nthe price I pay for what I want – but at least I know that I’ve got to pay it.\nAnd I have no illusions about the price or the purchase.\n\nI’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. It’s not my fault if\nyou couldn’t hear. You could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer\nthan deafness – for me. I said I intended to rule. Like all my spiritual\npredecessors. But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their\nefforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it\nall around me today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like\nit. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity\npermits. I shall rule.\n\n— Whom...?\n\nYou. The world. It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to\nrule one single man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, the\nsoul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas,\nthe Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, is that which\ncan’t be ruled. It must be broken. You won’t need a whip – he’ll bring it to you\nand ask to be whipped. Set him in reverse – and his own mechanism will do your\nwork for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever\nlied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to\nhear, and the fault is yours, not mine.\n\nThere are many ways. Here’s one.\n\nMake man feel small.\nMake him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult.\nThe worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity\nby internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal\ndestructive of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live\nfor others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has\never achieved it and not a single one ever will. His every living instinct\nscreams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that\nhe’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue – and it gives him a\nsense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal\nis beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all\nsense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can’t\npractice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve\none’s integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be\ncorrupt already? His soul gives up its self-respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. \nHe’ll be glad to obey – because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he\nfeels unclean. That’s one way.\n\nHere’s another.\n\nKill man’s sense of values.\nKill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be\nruled. We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny the conception of greatness.\nDestroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. \nSet up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept –\nand you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all\nincentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection.\n\nLaugh at the great and hold the mediocre as a great architect. You’ve destroyed\narchitecture. Build up [some morrow] and you’ve destroyed literature. Hail\n[other morrow] and you’ve destroyed the theater. Glorify [third morrow] and\nyou’ve destroyed the press. Don’t set out to raze all shrines – you’ll frighten\nmen. Enshrine mediocrity – and the shrines are razed.\n\nHere’s another way. This is most important.\n\nDon’t allow men to be happy.\nHappiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy men have no time and no\nuse for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from\nthem whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want.\nMake them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a\nstate where saying I want’ is no longer a natural right, but a shameful\nadmission. Altruism is of great help in this. Unhappy men will come to you.\nThey’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature\nallows no vacuum. Empty man’s soul – and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see\nwhy you should look so shocked. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at\nhistory. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all\npreach the sacrifice of personal joy? Under all the complications of verbiage,\nhaven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial?\nHaven’t you been able to catch their theme song – ’Give up, give up, give up,\ngive up’? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from\ncigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or\nsinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy – and you’ve damned it. That’s\nhow far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the\nthroat. Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace – lie on a bed of nails\n– go into the desert to mortify the flesh – don’t dance – don’t go to the movies\non Sunday – don’t try to get rich – don’t smoke – don’t drink. It’s all the same\nline. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense.\nSomething left over, old-fashioned.\n\nBut there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly – ask\nyourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached\nsacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you must\ndress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of\nhappiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don’t have to be\ntoo clear about it. Use big vague words.\n\n * Universal Harmony\n * Eternal Spirit\n * Divine Purpose\n * Nirvana\n * Paradise\n * Racial Supremacy\n * The Dictatorship of the Proletariat\n\nInternal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of all. The farce has been\ngoing on for centuries and men still fall for it. Yet the test should be so\nsimple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice – run.\nRun faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice,\nthere’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s\nsomeone being served.\n\nThe man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And\nintends to be the master.\n\nBut if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your\nnatural right, that your first duty is to yourself – that will be the man who’s\nnot after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But\nlet him come and you’ll scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish\nmonster. So the racket is safe for many, many centuries. But here you might have\nnoticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? Men have a weapon\nagainst you.\n\nReason.\nSo you must be very sure to take it away from them. Cut the props from under it.\nBut be careful. Don’t deny outright. Never deny anything outright, you give your\nhand away. Don’t say reason is evil – though some have gone that far and with\nastonishing success. Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something\nabove it. What? You don’t have to be too clear about it either. The field’s\ninexhaustible.\n\n * Instinct\n * Feeling\n * Revelation\n * Divine Intuition\n * Dialectic Materialism\n\nIf you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your\ndoctrine doesn’t make sense – you’re ready for him. You tell him that there’s\nsomething above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must\nbelieve. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild. Anything goes in any manner\nyou wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. Can you rule a thinking man? We\ndon’t want any thinking men.\n\n...and the World of the Future\nThe world of the future. The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A\nworld where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess\nthe thought of the brain of his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own but\nan attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought –\nand so on around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man\nwill hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the\ndesires of his neighbor who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of\nthe next neighbor who’ll have no desires – around the globe. Since all must\nserve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as\nmoney, but for that headless monster – prestige. The approval of his fellows –\ntheir good opinion – the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An\noctopus, all tentacles and no brain.\n\nJudgment! Not judgment, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeroes – since\nno individuality will be permitted. A world with its motor cut off and a single\nheart, pumped by hand. My hand – and the hands of a few, a very few other men\nlike me. Those who know what makes you tick – you great, wonderful average, you\nwho have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the\ncommon, you who’ve liked and accepted those names. You’ll sit enthroned and\nenshrined, you, the little people, the absolute ruler to make all past rulers\nsquirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet and King\ncombined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general. Do you know the\nproper antonym for Ego? Bromide. The rule of the bromide. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy\nunlimited submission – from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll\ncall it ‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one\nanother in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no\nother distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement.\n\nNow if you were a little more intelligent you’d ask: What of us, the rulers? And\nI’d say, Yes, you’re right. I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no\npurpose save to keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to\ninflate your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good. \nPeter, my poor old friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve every known. I have\nless independence than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used\npeople at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I\nwant nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them.\nIt’s my only function and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. I want power.\nI want my world of the future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none\nprofit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate.\nThere’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal\nslavery – without even the dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great\ncircle – and a total equality. The world of the future.\n\nBut then, unite and rule\nInsane? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it\ncoming? Isn’t it here? Every single thing I told you? Everything I said is\ncontained in a single word – collectivism. And isn’t that the god of our\ncentury? To act together. To think – together. To feel – together. To unite, to\nagree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer – first. But\nthen – unite and rule. We’ve discovered that one at last. Remember the Roman\nEmperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People\nhave laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve\naccomplished what he couldn’t accomplish. We’ve taught men to unite. This makes\none neck ready for one leash. We found the magic word. Collectivism. Look at\nEurope, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence?\n\nOne country is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the\ncollective is all. The individual held as evil, the mass – as God. No motive and\nno virtue permitted – except that of service to the proletariat. That’s one\nversion. Here’s another.\n\nA country dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the State is\nall. The individual held as evil, the race – as God. No motive and no virtue\npermitted – except that of service to the race.\n\nIf you’re sick of one version, we push you into the other. We get you coming and\ngoing. We’ve closed the doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads – collectivism, and\ntails – collectivism. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a\ndoctrine which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council – or\ngive it up to a leader. But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique,\nPeter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. Give the fools a choice, let\nthem have their fun – but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish.\nKill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow automatically. \nObserve the state of the world as of the present moment. Do you still think I’m\ncrazy?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgainst the men of their time\nThroughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads\narmed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had\nthis in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed,\nand the response they received – hatred. The great creators – the thinkers, the\nartists, the scientists, the inventors – stood alone against the men of their\ntime.\n\nEvery great new thought was opposed.\n\nEvery great new invention was denounced.\n\nThe first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible.\nThe power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the\nmen of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid.\nBut they won.\n\nThe individual mind\nBut the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a\ncollective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement\nreached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many\nindividual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act – the\nprocess of reason – must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal\namong many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his\nlungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another.\nAll the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or\ntransferred.\n\nWe inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. We\nmake a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane.\nBut all through the process what we receive from others is only the end product\nof their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes this\nproduct as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative faculty\ncannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single,\nindividual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn\nfrom one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can\ngive another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of\nsurvival.\n\nAltruism\nThe basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work\nunder any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to\nany consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in\nmotive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.\n\nThe basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to\nbe fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve\nothers. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man\nlive for others and place others above self.\n\nNo man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share\nhis body. But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation\nand reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been taught every\nprecept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence as a virtue.\n\nThe man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in\nmotive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing\nbut mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it\nin reality – the man who lives to serve others – is the slave. If physical\nslavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the\nspirit? The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having\nresisted and of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself\nvoluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the\ndignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence\nof altruism.\n\nMen have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet\none cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before\ndistribution – or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creator\ncomes before the need of any possible beneficiary.\n\nYet we are taught to admire the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not\nproduced above the man who made the gifts possible.\n\nWe praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement.\n\nThe greatest fraud\nMen have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator\nis the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with\nthe current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have\nbeen taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man\nwho stands alone.\n\nMen have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the\nideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, and the\nselfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are\nfunctions of the self.\n\nHere the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man has\nbeen left no alternative – and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was\noffered two conceptions: egotism and altruism. Egotism was held to mean the\nsacrifice of others to self. Altruism – the sacrifice of self to others. This\ntied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his\nown pain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake\nof self. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap\nwas closed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal – under the threat\nthat sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever\nperpetrated on mankind.\n\nThis was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as\nfundamentals of life. The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice\nis independence or dependence. The code of the creator or the code of the\nsecond-hander. This is the basic issue.\n\nPersonal dignity\nDegrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of\na man’s independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his\ntalent as a worker and his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of\nhuman virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or\nhasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no\nstandard of personal dignity except independence.\n\nDestroying the creators\nThe first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to\nhimself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of\nothers. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not\ndepend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative\nfaculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the\ngangster, the altruist and the dictator.\n\nA man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule – alone.\nRobbery, exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They\nare the province of the second-hander.\n\nRulers of men are not egotists. They create nothing. They exist entirely through\nthe persons of others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of\nenslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and the\nbandit. The form of dependence does not matter.\n\nBut men were taught to regard second-handers – tyrants, emperors, dictators – as\nexponents of egotism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego,\nthemselves and others. The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or\nto harness them. Which is a synonym.\n\nObserve the results\nFrom the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: the\ncreator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the\nfirst second-hander responded. He invented altruism.\n\nThe creator – denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited – went on, moved forward\nand carried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed\nnothing to the process except the impediments. The contest has another name: the\nindividual against the collective.\n\nThe ‘common good’ of a collective – a race, a class, a state – was the claim and\njustification of every tyranny ever established over men.\n\nEvery major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive. \nHas any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of\naltruism? Does the fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the\nprinciple?\n\nThe most dreadful butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect\nsociety reached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned\ntheir right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose. It\nwas accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men.\n\nActors change, but the course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian\nwho starts with declarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood. \nIt goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is\nunselfish. That permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it.\nThe leaders of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe\nthe results.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCivilization\nIt is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was\ndestroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is the\nprogress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence is public,\nruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free\nfrom men.\n\nNow, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater,\nthe ancient monster, has broken loose and is running amuck. It has brought men\nto a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth. It has reached a\nscale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind.\n\nI know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching\na world in which I cannot permit myself to

Then came communism and Nazism, which between them destroyed scores of millions of lives, in a fashion that only a few short decades before would have appeared inconceivable. __Many of the disasters of the twentieth century could be characterised as revolts against civilisation itself:__ the Cultural Revolution in China, for example, or the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Only ten years ago, in Rwanda, scores of thousands of ordinary people were transformed into pitiless murderers by demagogic appeals over the radio. They achieved a rate of slaughter with their machetes never equalled even by the Nazis with their gas chambers. Who now would bet heavily against such a thing ever happening again anywhere in the world?\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Unacknowledged legislators \\n\\nJohn Maynard Keynes wrote, in a famous passage in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, that practical men might not have much time for theoretical considerations, but in fact the world is governed by little else than the outdated or defunct ideas of economists and social philosophers. I agree: except that I would now add novelists, playwrights, film directors, journalists, artists, and even pop singers. They are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, and we ought to pay close attention to what they say and how they say it.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Let's pretend\\n\\nA ridiculous _pas de deux_ between doctor and patient ensues: __the patient pretends to be ill, and the doctor pretends to cure him__. In the process, the patient is wilfully blinded to the conduct that inevitably causes his misery in the first place. I have therefore come to see that one of the most important tasks of the doctor today is the disavowal of his own power and responsibility. The patient’s notion that he is ill stands in the way of his understanding of the situation, without which moral change cannot take place. The doctor who pretends to treat is an obstacle to this change, blinding rather than enlightening.\\n\\n\\n### Amorality\\n\\nWhen young people want to praise themselves, they describe themselves as ‘nonjudgmental.’ For them, the highest form of morality is amorality.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Story of modern Britain\\n\\nHe was thin and malnourished in the manner I have described. Five feet ten, he weighed just over 100 pounds. He told me what many young men in his situation have told me, that he asked the court not to grant him bail, so that he could recover his health in prison — something that he knew he would never do outside. A few months of incarceration would set him up nicely to indulge in heroin on his release. __Prison is the health farm of the slums__.\\n\\nThe existence of malnutrition in the midst of plenty has not entirely escaped either the intelligentsia or the government, which of course is proposing measures to combat it: but, as usual, neither pols nor pundits wish to look the problem in the face or make the obvious connections. For them, the real and most pressing question raised by any social problem is: ‘_How do I appear concerned and compassionate to all my friends, colleagues, and peers?_’ Needless to say, __the first imperative is to avoid any hint of blaming the victim by examining the bad choices that he makes__. It is not even permissible to look at the reasons for those choices, since by definition victims are victims and therefore not responsible for their acts, __unlike the relatively small class of human beings who are not victims__.\\n\\nThis is how the British government’s current Food Poverty Eradication Bill should be interpreted. By attempting to tackle the sources of supply rather than those of demand, it will sidestep the question of an entire way of life — a problem that it would take genuine moral courage to tackle — and aim at an easy target instead. The government will increase bureaucracy and regulation without reducing malnutrition. __This, in miniature, is the story of modern Britain.__\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n### Growing disdainful\\n\\nAnd when, having returned from a country in which half the population has been displaced and the infrastructure entirely destroyed, I hear complaints about the difficulty of finding taxis in the rain or delays in delivery of the mail, I am apt to grow disdainful. __The problem with having lived too long or too frequently in dangerous situations is that one ceases to care very much about the actual content of the existence one is so anxious to preserve__. Danger absolves one of the need to deal with a hundred quotidian problems or to make a thousand little choices, each one unimportant. Danger simplifies existence and therefore — again when chosen, not imposed — comes as a relief from many anxieties.\\n\\n### Deep disgust\\n\\nLooking around me in the township, I began to see that the spotlessly clean white uniform in which she appeared every day in the hospital represented not an absurd fetish, not the brutal imposition of alien cultural standards upon African life, but a noble triumph of the human spirit—as, indeed, did her tenderly cared-for home. By comparison with her struggle to maintain herself in decency, my former rejection of bourgeois proprieties and respectability seemed to me ever afterward to be shallow, trivial, and adolescent. Until then, I had assumed, along with most of my generation unacquainted with real hardship, that a scruffy appearance was a sign of spiritual election, representing a rejection of the superficiality and materialism of bourgeois life. Ever since then, however, I have not been able to witness the voluntary adoption of torn, worn out, and tattered clothes — at least in public — by those in a position to dress otherwise without a feeling of deep disgust. __Far from being a sign of solidarity with the poor, it is a perverse mockery of them; it is spitting on the graves of our ancestors, who struggled so hard, so long, and so bitterly that we might be warm, clean, well-fed, and leisured enough to enjoy the better things in life.__\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The most important phonomena of the last hundred years\\n\\nI took with me instead a work by a nineteenth-century French aristocrat, the Marquis de Custine. First published as a series of letters in 1843 under the title La Russie en 1839, the book has since appeared in a multiplicity of formats and abbreviated versions, with various titles in English, suggesting that even its translators and most fervent admirers do not consider it a flawless work of literary art. And yet this travel book is undoubtedly a masterpiece, a work of such penetration and prescience that it is worth reading more than a century and a half after its composition, not only for its antiquarian or historical interest but because of the incomparably brilliant light it sheds on one of the most important phenomena of the last hundred years: the spread of communism throughout the world.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nVisitors reached the palace by boat from Saint Petersburg, and one boat had sunk in a storm on the way to the festival with the loss of all its passengers and crew. But because _‘any mishap [in Russia] is treated as an affair of State’_ in Russia, and because _‘to lie is to protect the social order, to speak the truth is to destroy the State,’_ there followed _‘a silence more terrifying than the disaster itself.’_ In Russia, people of the highest social class — as were the boat’s passengers — could disappear not only without a trace but without comment. Who in such a country could ever feel safe?\\n\\nCustine appreciated only too well the violence that this remaking of history did to the minds of men, and the consequences it had for their character and behaviour. In order not to look at the palace in which the emperor Paul was murdered, a person had to know that he was killed there; but his whole purpose in not looking at the palace was to demonstrate in public his ignorance of the murder. __He thus had not only to assert a lie but also to deny that he knew it was a lie.__ And all officials — the emperor included — had likewise to pretend that they did not know they were being lied to, or else the whole edifice of falsehood would have come tumbling down. The need always to lie and always to avoid the truth stripped everyone of what Custine called _‘the two greatest gifts of God — the soul and the speech which communicates it.’_ __People became hypocritical, cunning, mistrustful, cynical, silent, cruel, and indifferent to the fate of others as a result of the destruction of their own souls.__\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n### Tocqueville, democracy and governments\\n\\nBut it was from this initial identity of interest that a potential danger arose. By small degrees — though this was only a possibility, not an inevitability — __men might cede their independence to a government that represented them__, that was believed to have their interests at heart, and that was (after all) composed of men very like themselves. In a passage that united prophetic with psychological insight, Tocqueville (__who rightly foresaw that democratic government was destined to spread widely, if not throughout the entire world__) described the future soul of man under a seemingly benevolent and democratic government that willingly laboured for the happiness of the people ‘_but chose to be the sole agent and only arbiter of that happiness_.’ Such a government would ‘_supply [the people] with their necessities, facilitate their pleasures, manage their principal concerns_.’ What would remain, but to ‘_spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living_’? When this came to pass, ‘_the will of man will not be shattered, but softened, bent and guided_.’ __Men will not be forced to act, but prevented from acting; the government will not destroy, but prevent a full human existence__. It will not tyrannise, but ‘_enervate, extinguish and stupefy a people_.’ __And this is exactly the condition to which a part of the population had been reduced under irreproachably democratic governments__.\\n\\nLiving in subsidised housing, its children educated free of charge and its medical bills paid (all for its own good, of course), with an income sufficient to guarantee both enough food and perpetual entertainment in the form of television, all its ‘_principal concerns_’ are _‘managed_,’ just as Tocqueville said they would be, and it is thus spared ‘_the care of thinking and all the trouble of living_.’\\n\\n\\nFor I work among people who are in effect paupers: and Tocqueville understood, as few modern writers do, that __pauperism is above all a psychological, not an economic, condition__. And he saw in the English system of __social assistance to the poor the same insidious threat to men’s independence of character__ that he saw, only as a potentiality, in American democracy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### The great dystopias\\n\\nThe great dystopias do not still command our interest because of their technological prescience. The contrivances they describe are often from today’s standpoint laughably naive. H. G. Wells’s time machine is hardly more than an elaborate bicycle made of ivory, nickel, and quartz. The radio reporter’s aluminium hat, filled with transmitting equipment, in Brave New World, strikes us today as ridiculous, despite Huxley’s reputation for scientific foresight. In 1984, Orwell imagines a computer as being full of nuts and bolts, with oil lubricating its operations—more steam engine than motherboard. __Yet, this technological naïveté finally does not matter, for the dystopians’ purpose is moral and political__.\\n\\nHuxley surmised that life lived as the satisfaction of one desire after another would result in shallow and egotistical people. True, he had a poor opinion of mankind to start with: ‘_About 99.5% of the entire population of the planet are as stupid,_’ he once wrote, ‘_as the great masses of the English_.’\\n\\n\\n#### The elites...\\n\\nThe ‘_root cause_’ of Liberia’s civil war, they said, had been the long dominance of an elite — in the same way, presumably, that poverty is often said to be the ‘_root cause_’ of crime. __The piano was an instrument, both musical and political, of that elite, and therefore its destruction was itself a step in the direction of democracy, an expression of the general will__. This way of thinking about culture and civilisation — possible only for people who believe that the comforts and benefits they enjoy are immortal and indestructible — has become almost standard among the intelligentsia of Western societies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Our decadence\\n\\nTo paraphrase Burke, all that is necessary for barbarism to triumph is for civilised men to do nothing: but in fact for the past few decades, civilised men have done worse than nothing — they have actively thrown in their lot with the barbarians. They have denied the __distinction between higher and lower__, to the invariable advantage of the latter. They have denied the __superiority of man’s greatest cultural achievements over the most ephemeral and vulgar of entertainments__; they have denied that the __scientific labours of brilliant men have resulted in an objective understanding of Nature__, and, like Pilate, they have __treated the question of truth as a jest__; above all, they have denied that it matters how people conduct themselves in their personal lives, provided only that they consent to their own depravity.\\n\\nAnd thus the obvious truth — that it is necessary to repress, either by law or by custom, the permanent possibility in human nature of brutality and barbarism — never finds its way into the press or other media of mass communication.\\n\\nThe philosophic argument is that, in a free society, adults should be permitted to do whatever they please, always provided that they are prepared to take the consequences of their own choices and that they cause no direct harm to others. The locus classicus for this point of view is John Stuart Mill’s famous essay On Liberty: ‘_The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of the community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others_,’ Mill wrote. ‘_His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant_.’ This radical individualism allows society no part whatever in shaping, determining, or enforcing a moral code: in short, we have nothing in common but our contractual agreement not to interfere with one another as we go about seeking our private pleasures.\\n\\nAnd so long as the demand for material goods outstrips supply, people will be tempted to commit criminal acts against the owners of property. This is not an argument, in my view, against private property or in favour of the common ownership of all goods. It does suggest, however, that we shall need a police force for a long time to come.\\n\\n\\n#### One man, one death\\n\\nIn claiming that __prohibition, not the drugs themselves, is the problem__, [...] and many others — even policemen — have said that ‘_the war on drugs is lost_.’ But to demand a yes or no answer to the question ‘_Is the war against drugs being won?_’ is like demanding a yes or no answer to the question ‘_Have you stopped beating your wife yet?_’ Never can an unimaginative and fundamentally stupid metaphor have exerted a more baleful effect upon proper thought. __Let us ask whether medicine is winning the war against death. The answer is obviously no, it isn’t winning__: the one fundamental rule of human existence remains, unfortunately, one man one death.\\n\\nThe present situation is bad, undoubtedly; but __few are the situations so bad that they cannot be made worse by a wrong policy decision__.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Upholding virtue & denouncing vice \\n\\n__The problem of upholding virtue and denouncing vice__ without appearing priggish, killjoy, bigoted, and narrow-minded has become so acute that __intellectuals are now inclined either to deny that there is a distinction between the two or to invert their value__.\\n\\nThere is no higher word of praise in an art critic’s vocabulary, for example, than ‘_transgressive_,’ as if transgression were in itself good, regardless of what is being transgressed. __Likewise, to break a taboo is to be a hero, irrespective of the content of the taboo__. Who is more contemned than he who clings stubbornly to old moral insights?\\n\\n\\n#### 1950's audience\\n\\nBut who, one might ask, had the deeper and subtler moral understanding of human relations: the audience of the mid-1950s or that of today? To the 1950s audience it would have been unnecessary to point out that, once a child had been conceived, the father owed a duty not only to the child, but to the mother; that his own wishes in the matter were not paramount, let alone all-important, and that he was not simply an individual but a member of a society whose expectations he had to meet if he were to retain its respect; and that a sense of moral obligation toward a woman was not inimical to a satisfying relationship with her but a precondition of it. To the present-day audience, by contrast, the only considerations in such a situation would be the individual inclinations of the parties involved, floating free of all moral or social constraints. __In the modern view, unbridled personal freedom is the only good to be pursued; any obstacle to it is a problem to be overcome.__\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### More democracy\\n\\nIn a democratic age, __only the behaviour of the authorities is subject to public criticism; that of the people themselves, never__. This is a modern version of Rousseau’s doctrine: if it weren’t for the authorities, the people would be good.\\n\\nIn the psychotherapeutic worldview to which all good liberals subscribe, there is no evil, only victimhood. The robber and the robbed, the murderer and the murdered, are alike the victims of circumstance, united by the events that overtook them. __Future generations (I hope) will find it curious how, in the century of Stalin and Hitler, we have been so eager to deny man’s capacity for evil__. Every now and again, however, a case arises that stirs a faint memory of this capacity — forgotten soon afterward.\\n\\n[...] that only the elderly tried to do anything about the situation, though physically least suited to do so. Could it be that only they had a view of right and wrong clear enough to wish to intervene? That everyone younger than they thought something like: ‘_Refugees . . . hard life . . . very poor . . . too young to know right from wrong and anyway never taught . . . no choice for them . . . punishment cruel and useless_’? \\n\\n[...] no one in the newspaper acknowledged that an effective police force is as vital a guarantee of personal freedom as a free press, and that the thin blue line that separates man from brutality is exactly that: thin. This is not a decent thing for an intellectual to say, however true it might be.\\n\\n[...] there is no more heartless saying than that the people get the government they deserve.\\n\\n#### Africa\\n\\nAfter several years in Africa, I concluded that the colonial enterprise had been fundamentally wrong and mistaken, even when, as was often the case in its final stages, it was benevolently intended. The good it did was ephemeral; the harm, lasting. __The powerful can change the powerless, it is true; but not in any way they choose__.\\n\\n__The unpredictability of humans is the revenge of the powerless__. What emerges politically from the colonial enterprise is often something worse, or at least more vicious because better equipped, than what existed before. Good intentions are certainly no guarantee of good results.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>Our Culture, or What's Left of It (Theodore Dalrymple, 2010)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"snippets\">Snippets</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What is this but a manifesto for Cool Britannia <em>avant la lettre</em>, an expression of the <strong>shallow belief</strong> that the new is better than the old merely by virtue of its novelty?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what is political correctness but Newspeak, the attempt to make certain thoughts inexpressible through the reform of language?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like all pacifists, Zweig evaded the question of how to protect the peaceful sheep from the ravening wolves, no doubt in the unrealistic hope that the wolves would one day discover the advantages of vegetarianism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No man was more sensitive than Zweig to the destructive effects upon individual liberty of the demands of large or strident collectivities.

To the present-day audience, by contrast, the only considerations in such a situation would be the individual inclinations of the parties involved, floating free of all moral or social constraints. <strong>In the modern view, unbridled personal freedom is the only good to be pursued; any obstacle to it is a problem to be overcome.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"moredemocracy\">More democracy</h3>\n<p>In a democratic age, <strong>only the behaviour of the authorities is subject to public criticism; that of the people themselves, never</strong>.

He\n   would have viewed with horror the cacophony of monomanias — sexual, racial,\n   social, egalitarian — that marks the intellectual life of our societies, each\n   monomaniac demanding legislative restriction on the freedom of others in the\n   name of a supposed greater, collective good.\n   \n   \n * Macbeth is aware throughout the play that what he does is morally wrong: he\n   never claims (as do so many modern relativists) that fair is foul and foul is\n   fair.\n   \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCivilization against itself\n[...] in much of the world, poverty is no longer absolute, a lack of food,\nshelter, or clothing; it is relative. Its miseries are no longer those of raw\nphysical deprivation but those induced by comparison with the vast numbers of\nprosperous people by whom the relatively poor are surrounded and whose\ncomparative wealth the poor feel as a wound, a reproach, and an injustice.\n\nThe Great War destroyed facile optimism that progress toward heaven on earth was\ninevitable or even possible. The most civilised of peoples proved capable of the\nmost horrific of organised violence. Then came communism and Nazism, which\nbetween them destroyed scores of millions of lives, in a fashion that only a few\nshort decades before would have appeared inconceivable. Many of the disasters of\nthe twentieth century could be characterised as revolts against civilisation\nitself: the Cultural Revolution in China, for example, or the Khmer Rouge in\nCambodia. Only ten years ago, in Rwanda, scores of thousands of ordinary people\nwere transformed into pitiless murderers by demagogic appeals over the radio.\nThey achieved a rate of slaughter with their machetes never equalled even by the\nNazis with their gas chambers. Who now would bet heavily against such a thing\never happening again anywhere in the world?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnacknowledged legislators\nJohn Maynard Keynes wrote, in a famous passage in The Economic Consequences of\nthe Peace, that practical men might not have much time for theoretical\nconsiderations, but in fact the world is governed by little else than the\noutdated or defunct ideas of economists and social philosophers. I agree: except\nthat I would now add novelists, playwrights, film directors, journalists,\nartists, and even pop singers. They are the unacknowledged legislators of the\nworld, and we ought to pay close attention to what they say and how they say it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's pretend\nA ridiculous pas de deux between doctor and patient ensues: the patient pretends\nto be ill, and the doctor pretends to cure him. In the process, the patient is\nwilfully blinded to the conduct that inevitably causes his misery in the first\nplace. I have therefore come to see that one of the most important tasks of the\ndoctor today is the disavowal of his own power and responsibility. The patient’s\nnotion that he is ill stands in the way of his understanding of the situation,\nwithout which moral change cannot take place. The doctor who pretends to treat\nis an obstacle to this change, blinding rather than enlightening.\n\nAmorality\nWhen young people want to praise themselves, they describe themselves as\n‘nonjudgmental.’ For them, the highest form of morality is amorality.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStory of modern Britain\nHe was thin and malnourished in the manner I have described. Five feet ten, he\nweighed just over 100 pounds. He told me what many young men in his situation\nhave told me, that he asked the court not to grant him bail, so that he could\nrecover his health in prison — something that he knew he would never do outside.\nA few months of incarceration would set him up nicely to indulge in heroin on\nhis release. Prison is the health farm of the slums.\n\nThe existence of malnutrition in the midst of plenty has not entirely escaped\neither the intelligentsia or the government, which of course is proposing\nmeasures to combat it: but, as usual, neither pols nor pundits wish to look the\nproblem in the face or make the obvious connections. For them, the real and most\npressing question raised by any social problem is: ‘How do I appear concerned\nand compassionate to all my friends, colleagues, and peers?’ Needless to say, \nthe first imperative is to avoid any hint of blaming the victim by examining the\nbad choices that he makes. It is not even permissible to look at the reasons for\nthose choices, since by definition victims are victims and therefore not\nresponsible for their acts, unlike the relatively small class of human beings\nwho are not victims.\n\nThis is how the British government’s current Food Poverty Eradication Bill\nshould be interpreted. By attempting to tackle the sources of supply rather than\nthose of demand, it will sidestep the question of an entire way of life — a\nproblem that it would take genuine moral courage to tackle — and aim at an easy\ntarget instead. The government will increase bureaucracy and regulation without\nreducing malnutrition. This, in miniature, is the story of modern Britain.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrowing disdainful\nAnd when, having returned from a country in which half the population has been\ndisplaced and the infrastructure entirely destroyed, I hear complaints about the\ndifficulty of finding taxis in the rain or delays in delivery of the mail, I am\napt to grow disdainful. The problem with having lived too long or too frequently\nin dangerous situations is that one ceases to care very much about the actual\ncontent of the existence one is so anxious to preserve. Danger absolves one of\nthe need to deal with a hundred quotidian problems or to make a thousand little\nchoices, each one unimportant. Danger simplifies existence and therefore — again\nwhen chosen, not imposed — comes as a relief from many anxieties.\n\nDeep disgust\nLooking around me in the township, I began to see that the spotlessly clean\nwhite uniform in which she appeared every day in the hospital represented not an\nabsurd fetish, not the brutal imposition of alien cultural standards upon\nAfrican life, but a noble triumph of the human spirit—as, indeed, did her\ntenderly cared-for home. By comparison with her struggle to maintain herself in\ndecency, my former rejection of bourgeois proprieties and respectability seemed\nto me ever afterward to be shallow, trivial, and adolescent. Until then, I had\nassumed, along with most of my generation unacquainted with real hardship, that\na scruffy appearance was a sign of spiritual election, representing a rejection\nof the superficiality and materialism of bourgeois life. Ever since then,\nhowever, I have not been able to witness the voluntary adoption of torn, worn\nout, and tattered clothes — at least in public — by those in a position to dress\notherwise without a feeling of deep disgust. Far from being a sign of solidarity\nwith the poor, it is a perverse mockery of them; it is spitting on the graves of\nour ancestors, who struggled so hard, so long, and so bitterly that we might be\nwarm, clean, well-fed, and leisured enough to enjoy the better things in life.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe most important phonomena of the last hundred years\nI took with me instead a work by a nineteenth-century French aristocrat, the\nMarquis de Custine. First published as a series of letters in 1843 under the\ntitle La Russie en 1839, the book has since appeared in a multiplicity of\nformats and abbreviated versions, with various titles in English, suggesting\nthat even its translators and most fervent admirers do not consider it a\nflawless work of literary art. And yet this travel book is undoubtedly a\nmasterpiece, a work of such penetration and prescience that it is worth reading\nmore than a century and a half after its composition, not only for its\nantiquarian or historical interest but because of the incomparably brilliant\nlight it sheds on one of the most important phenomena of the last hundred years:\nthe spread of communism throughout the world.\n\n[...]\n\nVisitors reached the palace by boat from Saint Petersburg, and one boat had sunk\nin a storm on the way to the festival with the loss of all its passengers and\ncrew. But because ‘any mishap [in Russia] is treated as an affair of State’ in\nRussia, and because ‘to lie is to protect the social order, to speak the truth\nis to destroy the State,’ there followed ‘a silence more terrifying than the\ndisaster itself.’ In Russia, people of the highest social class — as were the\nboat’s passengers — could disappear not only without a trace but without\ncomment. Who in such a country could ever feel safe?\n\nCustine appreciated only too well the violence that this remaking of history did\nto the minds of men, and the consequences it had for their character and\nbehaviour. In order not to look at the palace in which the emperor Paul was\nmurdered, a person had to know that he was killed there; but his whole purpose\nin not looking at the palace was to demonstrate in public his ignorance of the\nmurder. He thus had not only to assert a lie but also to deny that he knew it\nwas a lie. And all officials — the emperor included — had likewise to pretend\nthat they did not know they were being lied to, or else the whole edifice of\nfalsehood would have come tumbling down. The need always to lie and always to\navoid the truth stripped everyone of what Custine called ‘the two greatest gifts\nof God — the soul and the speech which communicates it.’ People became\nhypocritical, cunning, mistrustful, cynical, silent, cruel, and indifferent to\nthe fate of others as a result of the destruction of their own souls.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTocqueville, democracy and governments\nBut it was from this initial identity of interest that a potential danger arose.\nBy small degrees — though this was only a possibility, not an inevitability — \nmen might cede their independence to a government that represented them, that\nwas believed to have their interests at heart, and that was (after all) composed\nof men very like themselves. In a passage that united prophetic with\npsychological insight, Tocqueville (who rightly foresaw that democratic\ngovernment was destined to spread widely, if not throughout the entire world)\ndescribed the future soul of man under a seemingly benevolent and democratic\ngovernment that willingly laboured for the happiness of the people ‘but chose to\nbe the sole agent and only arbiter of that happiness.’ Such a government would ‘\nsupply [the people] with their necessities, facilitate their pleasures, manage\ntheir principal concerns.’ What would remain, but to ‘spare them all the care of\nthinking and all the trouble of living’? When this came to pass, ‘the will of\nman will not be shattered, but softened, bent and guided.’ Men will not be\nforced to act, but prevented from acting; the government will not destroy, but\nprevent a full human existence. It will not tyrannise, but ‘enervate, extinguish\nand stupefy a people.’ And this is exactly the condition to which a part of the\npopulation had been reduced under irreproachably democratic governments.\n\nLiving in subsidised housing, its children educated free of charge and its\nmedical bills paid (all for its own good, of course), with an income sufficient\nto guarantee both enough food and perpetual entertainment in the form of\ntelevision, all its ‘principal concerns’ are ‘managed,’ just as Tocqueville said\nthey would be, and it is thus spared ‘the care of thinking and all the trouble\nof living.’\n\nFor I work among people who are in effect paupers: and Tocqueville understood,\nas few modern writers do, that pauperism is above all a psychological, not an\neconomic, condition. And he saw in the English system of social assistance to\nthe poor the same insidious threat to men’s independence of character that he\nsaw, only as a potentiality, in American democracy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe great dystopias\nThe great dystopias do not still command our interest because of their\ntechnological prescience. The contrivances they describe are often from today’s\nstandpoint laughably naive. H. G. Wells’s time machine is hardly more than an\nelaborate bicycle made of ivory, nickel, and quartz. The radio reporter’s\naluminium hat, filled with transmitting equipment, in Brave New World, strikes\nus today as ridiculous, despite Huxley’s reputation for scientific foresight. In\n1984, Orwell imagines a computer as being full of nuts and bolts, with oil\nlubricating its operations—more steam engine than motherboard. Yet, this\ntechnological naïveté finally does not matter, for the dystopians’ purpose is\nmoral and political.\n\nHuxley surmised that life lived as the satisfaction of one desire after another\nwould result in shallow and egotistical people. True, he had a poor opinion of\nmankind to start with: ‘About 99.5% of the entire population of the planet are\nas stupid,’ he once wrote, ‘as the great masses of the English.’\n\nThe elites...\nThe ‘root cause’ of Liberia’s civil war, they said, had been the long dominance\nof an elite — in the same way, presumably, that poverty is often said to be the\n‘root cause’ of crime. The piano was an instrument, both musical and political,\nof that elite, and therefore its destruction was itself a step in the direction\nof democracy, an expression of the general will. This way of thinking about\nculture and civilisation — possible only for people who believe that the\ncomforts and benefits they enjoy are immortal and indestructible — has become\nalmost standard among the intelligentsia of Western societies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur decadence\nTo paraphrase Burke, all that is necessary for barbarism to triumph is for\ncivilised men to do nothing: but in fact for the past few decades, civilised men\nhave done worse than nothing — they have actively thrown in their lot with the\nbarbarians. They have denied the distinction between higher and lower, to the\ninvariable advantage of the latter. They have denied the superiority of man’s\ngreatest cultural achievements over the most ephemeral and vulgar of\nentertainments; they have denied that the scientific labours of brilliant men\nhave resulted in an objective understanding of Nature, and, like Pilate, they\nhave treated the question of truth as a jest; above all, they have denied that\nit matters how people conduct themselves in their personal lives, provided only\nthat they consent to their own depravity.\n\nAnd thus the obvious truth — that it is necessary to repress, either by law or\nby custom, the permanent possibility in human nature of brutality and barbarism\n— never finds its way into the press or other media of mass communication.\n\nThe philosophic argument is that, in a free society, adults should be permitted\nto do whatever they please, always provided that they are prepared to take the\nconsequences of their own choices and that they cause no direct harm to others.\nThe locus classicus for this point of view is John Stuart Mill’s famous essay On\nLiberty: ‘The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any\nmember of the community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others,’ Mill\nwrote. ‘His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.’\nThis radical individualism allows society no part whatever in shaping,\ndetermining, or enforcing a moral code: in short, we have nothing in common but\nour contractual agreement not to interfere with one another as we go about\nseeking our private pleasures.\n\nAnd so long as the demand for material goods outstrips supply, people will be\ntempted to commit criminal acts against the owners of property. This is not an\nargument, in my view, against private property or in favour of the common\nownership of all goods. It does suggest, however, that we shall need a police\nforce for a long time to come.\n\nOne man, one death\nIn claiming that prohibition, not the drugs themselves, is the problem, [...]\nand many others — even policemen — have said that ‘the war on drugs is lost.’\nBut to demand a yes or no answer to the question ‘Is the war against drugs being\nwon?’ is like demanding a yes or no answer to the question ‘Have you stopped\nbeating your wife yet?’ Never can an unimaginative and fundamentally stupid\nmetaphor have exerted a more baleful effect upon proper thought. Let us ask\nwhether medicine is winning the war against death. The answer is obviously no,\nit isn’t winning: the one fundamental rule of human existence remains,\nunfortunately, one man one death.\n\nThe present situation is bad, undoubtedly; but few are the situations so bad\nthat they cannot be made worse by a wrong policy decision.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpholding virtue & denouncing vice\nThe problem of upholding virtue and denouncing vice without appearing priggish,\nkilljoy, bigoted, and narrow-minded has become so acute that intellectuals are\nnow inclined either to deny that there is a distinction between the two or to\ninvert their value.\n\nThere is no higher word of praise in an art critic’s vocabulary, for example,\nthan ‘transgressive,’ as if transgression were in itself good, regardless of\nwhat is being transgressed. Likewise, to break a taboo is to be a hero,\nirrespective of the content of the taboo. Who is more contemned than he who\nclings stubbornly to old moral insights?\n\n1950's audience\nBut who, one might ask, had the deeper and subtler moral understanding of human\nrelations: the audience of the mid-1950s or that of today? To the 1950s audience\nit would have been unnecessary to point out that, once a child had been\nconceived, the father owed a duty not only to the child, but to the mother; that\nhis own wishes in the matter were not paramount, let alone all-important, and\nthat he was not simply an individual but a member of a society whose\nexpectations he had to meet if he were to retain its respect; and that a sense\nof moral obligation toward a woman was not inimical to a satisfying relationship\nwith her but a precondition of it. To the present-day audience, by contrast, the\nonly considerations in such a situation would be the individual inclinations of\nthe parties involved, floating free of all moral or social constraints. In the\nmodern view, unbridled personal freedom is the only good to be pursued; any\nobstacle to it is a problem to be overcome.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore democracy\nIn a democratic age, only the behaviour of the authorities is subject to public\ncriticism; that of the people themselves, never. This is a modern version of\nRousseau’s doctrine: if it weren’t for the authorities, the people would be\ngood.\n\nIn the psychotherapeutic worldview to which all good liberals subscribe, there\nis no evil, only victimhood. The robber and the robbed, the murderer and the\nmurdered, are alike the victims of circumstance, united by the events that\novertook them. Future generations (I hope) will find it curious how, in the\ncentury of Stalin and Hitler, we have been so eager to deny man’s capacity for\nevil. Every now and again, however, a case arises that stirs a faint memory of\nthis capacity — forgotten soon afterward.\n\n[...] that only the elderly tried to do anything about the situation, though\nphysically least suited to do so.

Na República a escola deveria selecionar os melhores para cuidar da cidade, e Aristóteles no seu livro Ética a Nicômaco fala da “grande alma” como o homem mais virtuoso e capaz, a partir do qual os outros vivem, como se a abundância de “força” desse homem alimentasse toda a comunidade. __O que fica claro em ambos é a percepção de que alguns poucos capazes são sempre responsáveis pelo mundo__. __A função da educação é exatamente identificar nos alunos suas diferenças e colocá-las a serviço da sociedade__. Os melhores lideram, os médios e medíocres seguem. Qualquer professor sabe disso numa sala de aula. Uma das maiores besteiras em educação é dizer que todos os alunos são iguais em capacidade de produzir e receber conhecimento.\\n\\nA maioria tende à covardia e à fraqueza. Desculpar a falta de força de caráter da maioria se transformou em fato comum numa certa filosofia “revolucionária” depois da “politização” da ética na esteira de Rousseau e Marx – ==ou da ideologização de tudo, como quando se culpa o capitalismo por tudo de mau no mundo==. Basicamente, o mundo sempre foi mau e continuará a ser, porque ele é fruto do comportamento humano, que parece ter certos pressupostos naturais.\\n\\nO _aristoi_ sofre muito mais do que o homem comum. É mais solitário, objeto de inveja e ódio, entende muito mais das coisas do que a maioria mediana, enfim, está muito longe da ideia de que os “melhores” são aproveitadores dos outros, pelo contrário, os outros vivem graças a estes (a “grande alma” do Aristóteles).\\n\\n\\n## Democracia\\n\\nComo dizia Tocqueville no século 19, autor do maior livro sobre democracia já escrito, Democracia na América, __a igualdade ama a mediocridade__.\\n\\nAliás, o risco da tirania do “povo” já tinha sido apontado pelo próprio Tocqueville. As __duas formas mais evidentes de tirania__ são a __da maioria__ e a __do dinheiro__ (criador de uma “aristocracia do dinheiro” em lugar da de sangue).\\n\\n...e combater a tendência de reduzir a democracia a um regime da “vontade popular” ou um regime “do povo”. __O povo é sempre opressor__. Quando aparece politicamente, é para quebrar coisas. O povo adere fácil e descaradamente (como aderiu nos séculos 19 e 20) a toda forma de totalitarismo. Se der comida, casa e hospital, o povo faz qualquer coisa que você pedir. __Confiar no povo como regulador da democracia é confiar nos bons modos de um leão à mesa. Só mentirosos e ignorantes têm orgasmos políticos com o “povo”__.\\n\\nOutra característica problemática da democracia é sua vocação tagarela, como dizia o conde de Tocqueville. Nela, as pessoas são estimuladas a ter opinião sobre tudo, e a afirmação de que todos os homens são iguais (quando a igualdade deve ser apenas perante um tribunal) leva as pessoas mais idiotas a assumir que são capazes de opinar sobre tudo. E, como dizia nosso conde, __Descartes nunca imaginou que alguém levasse tão a serio sua ideia de que o bom senso foi dado a todos os homens em “quantidades” iguais__ – o que evidentemente é uma mentira empírica. O resultado é que, se você põe em dúvida a capacidade igual entre os homens de ter opiniões, a sensibilidade democrática grita de agonia.\\n\\nUma coisa que nosso conde percebeu é que o homem da democracia, quando quer saber algo, pergunta para a pessoa do seu lado, e o que a maioria disser, ele assume como verdade. __Daí que, no lugar do conhecimento, a democracia criou a opinião pública__.\\n\\nMas talvez a pior coisa da democracia seja o fato de que ela deu aos idiotas a consciência de seu poder numérico, como dizia o sábio Nelson Rodrigues. Em suas colunas de jornais, o Nelson costumava dizer que ==os idiotas, maioria absoluta da humanidade==, antes do advento da Revolução Francesa, viviam suas vidas comendo, reproduzindo e babando na gravata. Com a Revolução Francesa e a democracia (que a primeira não criou exatamente porque foi muito mais um regime de terror autoritário), os idiotas perceberam que são em maior número, e de lá para cá todo mundo passou a ter de agradá-los, a fim de ter a possibilidade de existir (principalmente intelectualmente). __O nome disso é marketing. Todo mundo que pensa um pouco vive com medo da força democrática (numérica) dos idiotas__.\\n\\n> O politicamente correto é uma das faces iradas desses idiotas.\\n\\nO encontro de Tocqueville, Nelson Rodrigues e Oakeshott é evidente: o idiota raivoso fala sempre com força de bando e, na democracia de massa em que vivemos, ele sim tem o poder absoluto de destruir todos os que não se submetem a sua regra de estupidez bem adaptada.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Os outros\\n\\nExistem dois filósofos muito ligados a esta causa da “ética da alteridade” (o que não quer dizer que eles carregam em si a praga do politicamente correto), nome técnico para o frisson do amor a todos os outros. Um deles é ==Martin Buber==, e o outro, ==Emmanuel Levinas==, ambos do século 20 e ambos judeus.\\n\\nQuando os outros estão longe, do outro lado do oceano, é bonitinho amar todos os outros, mas, quando eles têm cheiro e hábitos outros, a coisa complica. A crítica à bobagem de o outro ser lindo não implica a defesa da destruição do outro, mas sim encararmos os impasses que a convivência com o outro gera para a filosofia e para a vida.\\n\\nO filme Avatar de alguns anos atrás é um exemplo ideal para entendermos o que é um romantismo para idiotas. No filme, a humanidade interesseira está destruindo uma civilização de índios azuis, os Naavis, que vivem num planeta cujo solo tem riquezas minerais. Ao final, alguns humanos unidos aos índios azuis salvam a “deusa natureza” do planeta, expulsam os malvados humanos (representantes da usura moderna) e voltam a viver em contato com a natureza. __Cenas como as que mostram conversas com árvores, bestas-feras que se unem aos bons índios azuis contra os capitalistas malvados ou os índios azuis de mãos dadas cantando sons mágicos ao redor de árvores emocionaram milhares de idiotas pelo mundo__. Todo mundo sabe que quase ninguém está disposto a viver como os índios, mas é comum gente boba achá-los “superavançados” com suas técnicas médicas do Neolítico. Abraçar árvores não resolve nada, muito menos supor que poderíamos voltar a viver em sociedades pré-escrita ou pré-roda. A menos que mais da metade da população mundial morresse, esses delírios não servem para nada.\\n\\nDaí que o justo medo da modernidade e do mundo do dinheiro pode fazer de você um retardado, como todo medo faz: corremos o risco de ficar em pânico e infantilizados. __Mas o que caracteriza o retardamento mental abençoado pelo politicamente correto é crer que voltarmos ao Neolítico nos salvaria das contradições do desenvolvimento da técnica, fruto de nossos próprios esforços para superar nossos sofrimentos__.\\n\\nO que se revela aqui é o ==eterno caráter retardado mental== (quando não mau caráter apenas) ==que o politicamente correto== aplica a este tema da natureza e dos animais: __a crueldade é parte dos esquemas de sobrevivência dos seres vivos, e não adianta projetarmos uma visão de pureza moral de nós mesmos, porque o mundo pararia de existir__. O que suspeito fortemente é de que esses caras apenas desejam passar a imagem de bonzinhos porque não gostam de comer carne.\\n\\n...com o tempo passei a suspeitar de que, sim, há uma pitada de mau-caratismo no feminismo e provavelmente porque suas líderes são, em grande maioria, feias e mal-amadas e por isso querem um mundo feio e infeliz para se sentir mais em casa.\\n\\nA beleza numa mulher me faz querer entendê-la melhor, ouvi-la melhor, ser mais generoso com ela, mais justo, enfim, ser um homem melhor. Não se trata apenas de um “desejo meramente animal” – se assim fosse, até seria menos danoso o mal que a praga politicamente correta gera ao negar a agonia da beleza no mundo devido à inveja das feias. O alcance espiritual da beleza é fato estudado pelas religiões: __o mal inveja a beleza do bem__. Mas, para além (ou aquém) da dimensão espiritual, não há nada melhor no mundo do que uma mulher linda a fim de você.\\n\\n...afora a covardia, sempre necessária para você se transformar em alguém que persegue os outros porque pensa diferente de você ou porque é melhor do que você. Nada é mais temido por um covarde do que a liberdade de pensamento. __Toda forma de totalitarismo__ (==o politicamente correto é uma forma de totalitarismo, e essa forma está presente na palavra “correto”==) __sobrevive graças às hordas de inseguros, medíocres e covardes que povoam a educação e o mundo da cultura e da arte__.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n##Universidade\\n\\n[...] a universidade é tomada por pessoas de personalidade insegura e medíocre que se escondem atrás de teorias consagradas a fim de garantir seu espaço “intelectual” nas instituições do conhecimento. Não apenas as universidades, mas também a mídia é povoada por pessoas que afirmam o que a maioria quer ouvir, porque isso garante adesões e reduz riscos de confronto. O politicamente correto é um caso típico de opção, por gerar adesões a um discurso autoritário. Basta analisarmos grande parte do que se fala na academia e na mídia para perceber o quanto se repete o mesmo papinho “do bem” que está longe de descrever a realidade, quase sempre intratável ao “Bem”.\\n\\nJuntando os dois argumentos, chegamos à mediocridade enturmada que caracteriza a vida intelectual e acadêmica. __Nada há de se esperar da universidade. As ciências duras ainda podem entregar remédios e robots, as ciências humanas não têm nada para entregar.__ Quando algo de importante nelas acontece, é à revelia das instituições que as sediam.\\n\\nTalvez não exista universo menos ético que o da cultura, da arte e da educação, mas graças a Deus ninguém sabe disso, e seus funcionários podem continuar posando de corretos.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Mulheres\\n\\nQualquer pessoa sabe que é difícil saber o que queremos com certeza. Uma das “vantagens negativas” da condição da mulher “antiga” era poder pôr a culpa no homem mesmo quando ela não sabia direito a causa de sua irritação – o fato é que ela ainda o faz, só que agora não podemos dizer que ela o faz. Um dos modos de o senso comum se referir à histeria feminina, não tão longe do pensamento freudiano, é dizer que a mulher não sabe o que quer e que se entedia com tudo o que tem. Não vou entrar no mérito dessa discussão técnica. É fato que a própria noção de que a mulher seria o sexo frágil sempre deu a ela a possibilidade de ter “crises” de modo mais tranquilo.\\n\\n...em apuros, porque, como todo homem sabe, a mulher nunca está satisfeita. __E, se você se preocupa em deixá-la satisfeita, você vive uma batalha sem fim, que ela mesma não reconhece como existente__. Faz parte da histeria não ter consciência de si mesma.\\n\\n\\n## Religião\\n\\nFalar mal do cristianismo e do judaísmo é esperado numa pessoa politicamente correta, porque essas religiões são “opressoras”, além, é claro, de ser provavelmente a religião dos pais deles, e por isso eles querem ser “críticos”. Desconfio muito de gente “crítica”. Normalmente as pessoas “críticas” posam para seus amigos “menos cultos” sua parca inteligência feita de generalidades.\\n\\n...é politicamente incorreto criticar o islamismo. Por isso digo que ser politicamente correto fere a inteligência ou revela mau caráter. __Não conheço ninguém que adote o politicamente correto e não seja mau-caráter, fora aqueles que têm idade mental de 10 anos__.\\n\\nDeus, de certa forma, tem de ficar um pouco ocioso como regente da vida comum. Nada disso se vê facilmente no mundo islâmico. Não entro no mérito de qual dos modelos de vida seja melhor, __digo apenas que não se vê muita gente fugindo daqui para lá, mas sim de lá para cá__.\\n\\n__Repete-se assim o movimento da esquerda em relação ao antigo regime comunista: enquanto eles defendiam esses regimes, gente como eles provavelmente morreriam sob esses regimes.__\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Hipocrisia\\n\\nNegar que a hipocrisia seja a matéria pura da moral social é parte da mentira do politicamente correto.\\n\\nO novo hipócrita social pensa que não esconde nenhum monstro dentro de si. Quando um idiota politicamente correto fala de si mesmo, pensa em si mesmo como um anjo que, por conta do domínio dos malvados (os “outros” que são os cruéis dominadores do mundo), não consegue viver o bem que ele carrega dentro de si. __Esse idiota usa a política como modo de esconder o mal em si mesmo__. A defesa que o mentiroso PC faz da humanidade é na realidade uma defesa de si mesmo. Ao fazer isso, ele nega ao homem a possibilidade de entrar em contato com seus próprios demônios e assim o torna um enganador de si mesmo, um retardado moral e um canalha que não se reconhece canalha e, por isso, não tem nem mesmo a dignidade de se saber mal, à semelhança de figuras trágicas como Lúcifer.\\n\\nOutra marca da praga PC assolando os “teóricos de Deus” é a negação sistemática que fazem da ideia de homem pecador em favor da ideia de homem como bom em si, mas dominado pelo peso do capitalismo. __A teologia da libertação retira do homem toda e qualquer capacidade de se ver como responsável pelo mal, a menos que ele seja rico, oprima sua mulher e seja homofóbico__.\\n\\nA praga PC detesta a culpa. Uma das coisas mais comuns nos politicamente corretos é negar a culpa dizendo que é a sociedade que “impõe” a culpa como forma de controle.\\n\\n...só fanático podia imaginar uma sociedade com “justiça social”, porque produzir riqueza tem a ver com originalidade, inteligência, capacidade de disciplina, e nada disso tem a ver com “igualdade”. A natureza não é igualitária em seus dons e suas dádivas, tampouco em suas misérias: __poucos são sempre melhores do que a maioria__. Isso não significa que devemos cultuar “injustiças sociais”, mas sim que o melhor remédio para “injustiça social” é riqueza e abundância, e não pregadores fanáticos pela justiça social.\\n\\n\\n## Europe\\n\\nÉ fácil você pregar sobre convivência com o outro quando sua população é rica e quase todo mundo tem olhos azuis, é loiro e tem um nome do tipo “Amundsen”. __É fácil repartir com poucas pessoas quando se tem muito__. Não é por acaso que os europeus se fecham aos imigrantes porque não querem dividir seu “sossego”. É normal, o ridículo é negar isso. O politicamente correto nega que seja normal (embora não seja “bonito”) ser egoísta e com isso dá uma roupagem bonita ao egoísmo, porque pretende torná-lo invisível.\\n\\nMuito do que o espírito humano produziu ele o fez em meio ao sofrimento. Isso não justifica o sofrimento, apenas indica que uma cultura da felicidade e da justiça social pode apenas gerar gente banal e medíocre.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Praga PC\\n\\n> Todo mundo gosta de pensar em si mesmo como corajoso. __O politicamente correto assume que a humanidade é boa em si, mas apenas sofre más influências__ (de onde viriam essas más influências?). Esse modo de pensar revela a face autoajuda da praga PC.\\n\\nIndependentemente do fato de que ditaduras são horríveis, a brasileira não liquidou a esquerda como se fala por aí. E mesmo os tais guerrilheiros lutavam por uma outra forma de ditadura. Tivesse a guerrilha de esquerda vencido a batalha, nós acordaríamos numa grande Cuba. __A ditadura, de certa forma, nos salvou do pior__.\\n\\nNada pior do que essas pessoas que não sabem nada, mas não sabem que não sabem nada, e levam suas vidas banais (toda vida é banal, mas a classe média com sua infinita baixa autoestima não sobrevive a esse fato) como se tivessem algum grande valor que não foi descoberto pelos outros.\\n\\nNa verdade é duro ser gente mesmo. E a maioria de nós é irrelevante mesmo, se arrasta pelo mundo como uma raça de abandonados que riem com pó entre os dentes. Mas o politicamente correto nos proíbe de dizer esta verdade: o leitor e o telespectador são idiotas, e no fundo nós, que “somos a mídia”, pouco os levamos em conta porque quase nada do que eles dizem vale a pena. Não fosse pela desgraça do mundo capitalista (que nos obriga a ouvir esse sujeito porque ele é consumidor e há de disputá-lo como consumidor), não precisaríamos dele e poderíamos dizer-lhe esta verdade insuperável: você é um idiota e, se não fosse consumidor de nosso produto, esqueceríamos que você existe.\\n\\nNada mais chato do que o medo de não agradar. __Não querer agradar é uma das maiores formas de libertação num mundo em que somos obrigados a amar tudo a nossa volta__. Ninguém é capaz de tanto amor; amamos, quando muito, nossos familiares (e olhe lá) e umas duas ou três pessoas a mais. Uma das formas mais comuns de agradar é ter amores politicamente corretos. Por exemplo, deveriam vender tribos de índio para defendermos e provarmos que temos “consciência ecossocial” – mentira, índios brasileiros só não destruíram a mata atlântica porque viviam no Neolítico e nem conheciam a roda. A praga PC diz amar toda forma de vítima social, mas isso não passa de marketing. No dia a dia, são canalhas cheios de falso amor. Fizessem uma pesquisa de fato, provavelmente ninguém seria capaz de comprovar tanto amor pela humanidade.\\n\\n__A canalhice sempre pagou bem nesse mundo__, e o politicamente correto é uma das novas formas de canalhice que assolam o mundo da cultura, da academia e da mídia.\\n\\nA ideia de que qualquer coisa que venha do povo é boa é absurda. __Além do mais, a maior parte do povo é idiota porque a maioria é sempre idiota e infantil__.

No filme, a humanidade interesseira está destruindo uma civilização de índios azuis, os Naavis, que vivem num planeta cujo solo tem riquezas minerais. Ao final, alguns humanos unidos aos índios azuis salvam a “deusa natureza” do planeta, expulsam os malvados humanos (representantes da usura moderna) e voltam a viver em contato com a natureza. <strong>Cenas como as que mostram conversas com árvores, bestas-feras que se unem aos bons índios azuis contra os capitalistas malvados ou os índios azuis de mãos dadas cantando sons mágicos ao redor de árvores emocionaram milhares de idiotas pelo mundo</strong>. Todo mundo sabe que quase ninguém está disposto a viver como os índios, mas é comum gente boba achá-los “superavançados” com suas técnicas médicas do Neolítico. Abraçar árvores não resolve nada, muito menos supor que poderíamos voltar a viver em sociedades pré-escrita ou pré-roda. A menos que mais da metade da população mundial morresse, esses delírios não servem para nada.</p>\n<p>Daí que o justo medo da modernidade e do mundo do dinheiro pode fazer de você um retardado, como todo medo faz: corremos o risco de ficar em pânico e infantilizados. <strong>Mas o que caracteriza o retardamento mental abençoado pelo politicamente correto é crer que voltarmos ao Neolítico nos salvaria das contradições do desenvolvimento da técnica, fruto de nossos próprios esforços para superar nossos sofrimentos</strong>.</p>\n<p>O que se revela aqui é o <mark>eterno caráter retardado mental</mark> (quando não mau caráter apenas) <mark>que o politicamente correto</mark> aplica a este tema da natureza e dos animais: <strong>a crueldade é parte dos esquemas de sobrevivência dos seres vivos, e não adianta projetarmos uma visão de pureza moral de nós mesmos, porque o mundo pararia de existir</strong>. O que suspeito fortemente é de que esses caras apenas desejam passar a imagem de bonzinhos porque não gostam de comer carne.</p>\n<p>...com o tempo passei a suspeitar de que, sim, há uma pitada de mau-caratismo no feminismo e provavelmente porque suas líderes são, em grande maioria, feias e mal-amadas e por isso querem um mundo feio e infeliz para se sentir mais em casa.</p>\n<p>A beleza numa mulher me faz querer entendê-la melhor, ouvi-la melhor, ser mais generoso com ela, mais justo, enfim, ser um homem melhor. Não se trata apenas de um “desejo meramente animal” – se assim fosse, até seria menos danoso o mal que a praga politicamente correta gera ao negar a agonia da beleza no mundo devido à inveja das feias. O alcance espiritual da beleza é fato estudado pelas religiões: <strong>o mal inveja a beleza do bem</strong>. Mas, para além (ou aquém) da dimensão espiritual, não há nada melhor no mundo do que uma mulher linda a fim de você.</p>\n<p>...afora a covardia, sempre necessária para você se transformar em alguém que persegue os outros porque pensa diferente de você ou porque é melhor do que você. Nada é mais temido por um covarde do que a liberdade de pensamento. <strong>Toda forma de totalitarismo</strong> (<mark>o politicamente correto é uma forma de totalitarismo, e essa forma está presente na palavra “correto”</mark>) <strong>sobrevive graças às hordas de inseguros, medíocres e covardes que povoam a educação e o mundo da cultura e da arte</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"universidade\">Universidade</h2>\n<p>[...] a universidade é tomada por pessoas de personalidade insegura e medíocre que se escondem atrás de teorias consagradas a fim de garantir seu espaço “intelectual” nas instituições do conhecimento. Não apenas as universidades, mas também a mídia é povoada por pessoas que afirmam o que a maioria quer ouvir, porque isso garante adesões e reduz riscos de confronto. O politicamente correto é um caso típico de opção, por gerar adesões a um discurso autoritário. Basta analisarmos grande parte do que se fala na academia e na mídia para perceber o quanto se repete o mesmo papinho “do bem” que está longe de descrever a realidade, quase sempre intratável ao “Bem”.</p>\n<p>Juntando os dois argumentos, chegamos à mediocridade enturmada que caracteriza a vida intelectual e acadêmica. <strong>Nada há de se esperar da universidade. As ciências duras ainda podem entregar remédios e robots, as ciências humanas não têm nada para entregar.</strong> Quando algo de importante nelas acontece, é à revelia das instituições que as sediam.</p>\n<p>Talvez não exista universo menos ético que o da cultura, da arte e da educação, mas graças a Deus ninguém sabe disso, e seus funcionários podem continuar posando de corretos.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"mulheres\">Mulheres</h2>\n<p>Qualquer pessoa sabe que é difícil saber o que queremos com certeza. Uma das “vantagens negativas” da condição da mulher “antiga” era poder pôr a culpa no homem mesmo quando ela não sabia direito a causa de sua irritação – o fato é que ela ainda o faz, só que agora não podemos dizer que ela o faz. Um dos modos de o senso comum se referir à histeria feminina, não tão longe do pensamento freudiano, é dizer que a mulher não sabe o que quer e que se entedia com tudo o que tem. Não vou entrar no mérito dessa discussão técnica. É fato que a própria noção de que a mulher seria o sexo frágil sempre deu a ela a possibilidade de ter “crises” de modo mais tranquilo.</p>\n<p>...em apuros, porque, como todo homem sabe, a mulher nunca está satisfeita. <strong>E, se você se preocupa em deixá-la satisfeita, você vive uma batalha sem fim, que ela mesma não reconhece como existente</strong>. Faz parte da histeria não ter consciência de si mesma.</p>\n<h2 id=\"religio\">Religião</h2>\n<p>Falar mal do cristianismo e do judaísmo é esperado numa pessoa politicamente correta, porque essas religiões são “opressoras”, além, é claro, de ser provavelmente a religião dos pais deles, e por isso eles querem ser “críticos”. Desconfio muito de gente “crítica”. Normalmente as pessoas “críticas” posam para seus amigos “menos cultos” sua parca inteligência feita de generalidades.</p>\n<p>...é politicamente incorreto criticar o islamismo. Por isso digo que ser politicamente correto fere a inteligência ou revela mau caráter. <strong>Não conheço ninguém que adote o politicamente correto e não seja mau-caráter, fora aqueles que têm idade mental de 10 anos</strong>.</p>\n<p>Deus, de certa forma, tem de ficar um pouco ocioso como regente da vida comum. Nada disso se vê facilmente no mundo islâmico. Não entro no mérito de qual dos modelos de vida seja melhor, <strong>digo apenas que não se vê muita gente fugindo daqui para lá, mas sim de lá para cá</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Repete-se assim o movimento da esquerda em relação ao antigo regime comunista: enquanto eles defendiam esses regimes, gente como eles provavelmente morreriam sob esses regimes.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"hipocrisia\">Hipocrisia</h2>\n<p>Negar que a hipocrisia seja a matéria pura da moral social é parte da mentira do politicamente correto.</p>\n<p>O novo hipócrita social pensa que não esconde nenhum monstro dentro de si. Quando um idiota politicamente correto fala de si mesmo, pensa em si mesmo como um anjo que, por conta do domínio dos malvados (os “outros” que são os cruéis dominadores do mundo), não consegue viver o bem que ele carrega dentro de si. <strong>Esse idiota usa a política como modo de esconder o mal em si mesmo</strong>. A defesa que o mentiroso PC faz da humanidade é na realidade uma defesa de si mesmo. Ao fazer isso, ele nega ao homem a possibilidade de entrar em contato com seus próprios demônios e assim o torna um enganador de si mesmo, um retardado moral e um canalha que não se reconhece canalha e, por isso, não tem nem mesmo a dignidade de se saber mal, à semelhança de figuras trágicas como Lúcifer.</p>\n<p>Outra marca da praga PC assolando os “teóricos de Deus” é a negação sistemática que fazem da ideia de homem pecador em favor da ideia de homem como bom em si, mas dominado pelo peso do capitalismo. <strong>A teologia da libertação retira do homem toda e qualquer capacidade de se ver como responsável pelo mal, a menos que ele seja rico, oprima sua mulher e seja homofóbico</strong>.</p>\n<p>A praga PC detesta a culpa. Uma das coisas mais comuns nos politicamente corretos é negar a culpa dizendo que é a sociedade que “impõe” a culpa como forma de controle.</p>\n<p>...só fanático podia imaginar uma sociedade com “justiça social”, porque produzir riqueza tem a ver com originalidade, inteligência, capacidade de disciplina, e nada disso tem a ver com “igualdade”. A natureza não é igualitária em seus dons e suas dádivas, tampouco em suas misérias: <strong>poucos são sempre melhores do que a maioria</strong>. Isso não significa que devemos cultuar “injustiças sociais”, mas sim que o melhor remédio para “injustiça social” é riqueza e abundância, e não pregadores fanáticos pela justiça social.</p>\n<h2 id=\"europe\">Europe</h2>\n<p>É fácil você pregar sobre convivência com o outro quando sua população é rica e quase todo mundo tem olhos azuis, é loiro e tem um nome do tipo “Amundsen”. <strong>É fácil repartir com poucas pessoas quando se tem muito</strong>. Não é por acaso que os europeus se fecham aos imigrantes porque não querem dividir seu “sossego”. É normal, o ridículo é negar isso. O politicamente correto nega que seja normal (embora não seja “bonito”) ser egoísta e com isso dá uma roupagem bonita ao egoísmo, porque pretende torná-lo invisível.</p>\n<p>Muito do que o espírito humano produziu ele o fez em meio ao sofrimento. Isso não justifica o sofrimento, apenas indica que uma cultura da felicidade e da justiça social pode apenas gerar gente banal e medíocre.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"pragapc\">Praga PC</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Todo mundo gosta de pensar em si mesmo como corajoso. <strong>O politicamente correto assume que a humanidade é boa em si, mas apenas sofre más influências</strong> (de onde viriam essas más influências?). Esse modo de pensar revela a face autoajuda da praga PC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Independentemente do fato de que ditaduras são horríveis, a brasileira não liquidou a esquerda como se fala por aí. E mesmo os tais guerrilheiros lutavam por uma outra forma de ditadura. Tivesse a guerrilha de esquerda vencido a batalha, nós acordaríamos numa grande Cuba. <strong>A ditadura, de certa forma, nos salvou do pior</strong>.</p>\n<p>Nada pior do que essas pessoas que não sabem nada, mas não sabem que não sabem nada, e levam suas vidas banais (toda vida é banal, mas a classe média com sua infinita baixa autoestima não sobrevive a esse fato) como se tivessem algum grande valor que não foi descoberto pelos outros.</p>\n<p>Na verdade é duro ser gente mesmo. E a maioria de nós é irrelevante mesmo, se arrasta pelo mundo como uma raça de abandonados que riem com pó entre os dentes. Mas o politicamente correto nos proíbe de dizer esta verdade: o leitor e o telespectador são idiotas, e no fundo nós, que “somos a mídia”, pouco os levamos em conta porque quase nada do que eles dizem vale a pena. Não fosse pela desgraça do mundo capitalista (que nos obriga a ouvir esse sujeito porque ele é consumidor e há de disputá-lo como consumidor), não precisaríamos dele e poderíamos dizer-lhe esta verdade insuperável: você é um idiota e, se não fosse consumidor de nosso produto, esqueceríamos que você existe.</p>\n<p>Nada mais chato do que o medo de não agradar. <strong>Não querer agradar é uma das maiores formas de libertação num mundo em que somos obrigados a amar tudo a nossa volta</strong>. Ninguém é capaz de tanto amor; amamos, quando muito, nossos familiares (e olhe lá) e umas duas ou três pessoas a mais. Uma das formas mais comuns de agradar é ter amores politicamente corretos. Por exemplo, deveriam vender tribos de índio para defendermos e provarmos que temos “consciência ecossocial” – mentira, índios brasileiros só não destruíram a mata atlântica porque viviam no Neolítico e nem conheciam a roda. A praga PC diz amar toda forma de vítima social, mas isso não passa de marketing. No dia a dia, são canalhas cheios de falso amor. Fizessem uma pesquisa de fato, provavelmente ninguém seria capaz de comprovar tanto amor pela humanidade.</p>\n<p><strong>A canalhice sempre pagou bem nesse mundo</strong>, e o politicamente correto é uma das novas formas de canalhice que assolam o mundo da cultura, da academia e da mídia.</p>\n<p>A ideia de que qualquer coisa que venha do povo é boa é absurda. <strong>Além do mais, a maior parte do povo é idiota porque a maioria é sempre idiota e infantil</strong>.

Não se trata apenas de\num “desejo meramente animal” – se assim fosse, até seria menos danoso o mal que\na praga politicamente correta gera ao negar a agonia da beleza no mundo devido à\ninveja das feias. O alcance espiritual da beleza é fato estudado pelas\nreligiões: o mal inveja a beleza do bem. Mas, para além (ou aquém) da dimensão\nespiritual, não há nada melhor no mundo do que uma mulher linda a fim de você.\n\n...afora a covardia, sempre necessária para você se transformar em alguém que\npersegue os outros porque pensa diferente de você ou porque é melhor do que\nvocê. Nada é mais temido por um covarde do que a liberdade de pensamento. Toda\nforma de totalitarismo (o politicamente correto é uma forma de totalitarismo, e\nessa forma está presente na palavra “correto”) sobrevive graças às hordas de\ninseguros, medíocres e covardes que povoam a educação e o mundo da cultura e da\narte.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUniversidade\n[...] a universidade é tomada por pessoas de personalidade insegura e medíocre\nque se escondem atrás de teorias consagradas a fim de garantir seu espaço\n“intelectual” nas instituições do conhecimento. Não apenas as universidades, mas\ntambém a mídia é povoada por pessoas que afirmam o que a maioria quer ouvir,\nporque isso garante adesões e reduz riscos de confronto. O politicamente correto\né um caso típico de opção, por gerar adesões a um discurso autoritário. Basta\nanalisarmos grande parte do que se fala na academia e na mídia para perceber o\nquanto se repete o mesmo papinho “do bem” que está longe de descrever a\nrealidade, quase sempre intratável ao “Bem”.\n\nJuntando os dois argumentos, chegamos à mediocridade enturmada que caracteriza a\nvida intelectual e acadêmica. Nada há de se esperar da universidade. As ciências\nduras ainda podem entregar remédios e robots, as ciências humanas não têm nada\npara entregar. Quando algo de importante nelas acontece, é à revelia das\ninstituições que as sediam.\n\nTalvez não exista universo menos ético que o da cultura, da arte e da educação,\nmas graças a Deus ninguém sabe disso, e seus funcionários podem continuar\nposando de corretos.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMulheres\nQualquer pessoa sabe que é difícil saber o que queremos com certeza. Uma das\n“vantagens negativas” da condição da mulher “antiga” era poder pôr a culpa no\nhomem mesmo quando ela não sabia direito a causa de sua irritação – o fato é que\nela ainda o faz, só que agora não podemos dizer que ela o faz. Um dos modos de o\nsenso comum se referir à histeria feminina, não tão longe do pensamento\nfreudiano, é dizer que a mulher não sabe o que quer e que se entedia com tudo o\nque tem. Não vou entrar no mérito dessa discussão técnica. É fato que a própria\nnoção de que a mulher seria o sexo frágil sempre deu a ela a possibilidade de\nter “crises” de modo mais tranquilo.\n\n...em apuros, porque, como todo homem sabe, a mulher nunca está satisfeita. E,\nse você se preocupa em deixá-la satisfeita, você vive uma batalha sem fim, que\nela mesma não reconhece como existente. Faz parte da histeria não ter\nconsciência de si mesma.\n\nReligião\nFalar mal do cristianismo e do judaísmo é esperado numa pessoa politicamente\ncorreta, porque essas religiões são “opressoras”, além, é claro, de ser\nprovavelmente a religião dos pais deles, e por isso eles querem ser “críticos”.\nDesconfio muito de gente “crítica”. Normalmente as pessoas “críticas” posam para\nseus amigos “menos cultos” sua parca inteligência feita de generalidades.\n\n...é politicamente incorreto criticar o islamismo. Por isso digo que ser\npoliticamente correto fere a inteligência ou revela mau caráter. Não conheço\nninguém que adote o politicamente correto e não seja mau-caráter, fora aqueles\nque têm idade mental de 10 anos.\n\nDeus, de certa forma, tem de ficar um pouco ocioso como regente da vida comum.\nNada disso se vê facilmente no mundo islâmico. Não entro no mérito de qual dos\nmodelos de vida seja melhor, digo apenas que não se vê muita gente fugindo daqui\npara lá, mas sim de lá para cá.\n\nRepete-se assim o movimento da esquerda em relação ao antigo regime comunista:\nenquanto eles defendiam esses regimes, gente como eles provavelmente morreriam\nsob esses regimes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHipocrisia\nNegar que a hipocrisia seja a matéria pura da moral social é parte da mentira do\npoliticamente correto.\n\nO novo hipócrita social pensa que não esconde nenhum monstro dentro de si.\nQuando um idiota politicamente correto fala de si mesmo, pensa em si mesmo como\num anjo que, por conta do domínio dos malvados (os “outros” que são os cruéis\ndominadores do mundo), não consegue viver o bem que ele carrega dentro de si. \nEsse idiota usa a política como modo de esconder o mal em si mesmo. A defesa que\no mentiroso PC faz da humanidade é na realidade uma defesa de si mesmo. Ao fazer\nisso, ele nega ao homem a possibilidade de entrar em contato com seus próprios\ndemônios e assim o torna um enganador de si mesmo, um retardado moral e um\ncanalha que não se reconhece canalha e, por isso, não tem nem mesmo a dignidade\nde se saber mal, à semelhança de figuras trágicas como Lúcifer.\n\nOutra marca da praga PC assolando os “teóricos de Deus” é a negação sistemática\nque fazem da ideia de homem pecador em favor da ideia de homem como bom em si,\nmas dominado pelo peso do capitalismo. A teologia da libertação retira do homem\ntoda e qualquer capacidade de se ver como responsável pelo mal, a menos que ele\nseja rico, oprima sua mulher e seja homofóbico.\n\nA praga PC detesta a culpa. Uma das coisas mais comuns nos politicamente\ncorretos é negar a culpa dizendo que é a sociedade que “impõe” a culpa como\nforma de controle.\n\n...só fanático podia imaginar uma sociedade com “justiça social”, porque\nproduzir riqueza tem a ver com originalidade, inteligência, capacidade de\ndisciplina, e nada disso tem a ver com “igualdade”. A natureza não é igualitária\nem seus dons e suas dádivas, tampouco em suas misérias: poucos são sempre\nmelhores do que a maioria. Isso não significa que devemos cultuar “injustiças\nsociais”, mas sim que o melhor remédio para “injustiça social” é riqueza e\nabundância, e não pregadores fanáticos pela justiça social.\n\nEurope\nÉ fácil você pregar sobre convivência com o outro quando sua população é rica e\nquase todo mundo tem olhos azuis, é loiro e tem um nome do tipo “Amundsen”. É\nfácil repartir com poucas pessoas quando se tem muito. Não é por acaso que os\neuropeus se fecham aos imigrantes porque não querem dividir seu “sossego”. É\nnormal, o ridículo é negar isso. O politicamente correto nega que seja normal\n(embora não seja “bonito”) ser egoísta e com isso dá uma roupagem bonita ao\negoísmo, porque pretende torná-lo invisível.\n\nMuito do que o espírito humano produziu ele o fez em meio ao sofrimento. Isso\nnão justifica o sofrimento, apenas indica que uma cultura da felicidade e da\njustiça social pode apenas gerar gente banal e medíocre.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPraga PC\n> Todo mundo gosta de pensar em si mesmo como corajoso. O politicamente correto\nassume que a humanidade é boa em si, mas apenas sofre más influências (de onde\nviriam essas más influências?). Esse modo de pensar revela a face autoajuda da\npraga PC.\n\n\nIndependentemente do fato de que ditaduras são horríveis, a brasileira não\nliquidou a esquerda como se fala por aí. E mesmo os tais guerrilheiros lutavam\npor uma outra forma de ditadura. Tivesse a guerrilha de esquerda vencido a\nbatalha, nós acordaríamos numa grande Cuba. A ditadura, de certa forma, nos\nsalvou do pior.\n\nNada pior do que essas pessoas que não sabem nada, mas não sabem que não sabem\nnada, e levam suas vidas banais (toda vida é banal, mas a classe média com sua\ninfinita baixa autoestima não sobrevive a esse fato) como se tivessem algum\ngrande valor que não foi descoberto pelos outros.\n\nNa verdade é duro ser gente mesmo. E a maioria de nós é irrelevante mesmo, se\narrasta pelo mundo como uma raça de abandonados que riem com pó entre os dentes.\nMas o politicamente correto nos proíbe de dizer esta verdade: o leitor e o\ntelespectador são idiotas, e no fundo nós, que “somos a mídia”, pouco os levamos\nem conta porque quase nada do que eles dizem vale a pena. Não fosse pela\ndesgraça do mundo capitalista (que nos obriga a ouvir esse sujeito porque ele é\nconsumidor e há de disputá-lo como consumidor), não precisaríamos dele e\npoderíamos dizer-lhe esta verdade insuperável: você é um idiota e, se não fosse\nconsumidor de nosso produto, esqueceríamos que você existe.\n\nNada mais chato do que o medo de não agradar. Não querer agradar é uma das\nmaiores formas de libertação num mundo em que somos obrigados a amar tudo a\nnossa volta. Ninguém é capaz de tanto amor; amamos, quando muito, nossos\nfamiliares (e olhe lá) e umas duas ou três pessoas a mais. Uma das formas mais\ncomuns de agradar é ter amores politicamente corretos. Por exemplo, deveriam\nvender tribos de índio para defendermos e provarmos que temos “consciência\necossocial” – mentira, índios brasileiros só não destruíram a mata atlântica\nporque viviam no Neolítico e nem conheciam a roda. A praga PC diz amar toda\nforma de vítima social, mas isso não passa de marketing. No dia a dia, são\ncanalhas cheios de falso amor. Fizessem uma pesquisa de fato, provavelmente\nninguém seria capaz de comprovar tanto amor pela humanidade.\n\nA canalhice sempre pagou bem nesse mundo, e o politicamente correto é uma das\nnovas formas de canalhice que assolam o mundo da cultura, da academia e da\nmídia.\n\nA ideia de que qualquer coisa que venha do povo é boa é absurda. Além do mais, a\nmaior parte do povo é idiota porque a maioria é sempre idiota e infantil.\nAssocia-se a esse fato geral uma outra marca mais específica desse caso, que é a\nquestão dos negros e da indústria das vítimas sociais e históricas como\nentidades sagradas da verdade moral.\n\nComo diz o psiquiatra inglês Theodore Dalrymple, o ressentimento é um dos\nsentimentos mais fortes e duradouros na experiência humana, e o welfare state,\nao encher as pessoas com direitos a (quase) tudo, cria uma situação peculiar,\nque é fazer com que os cidadãos sejam, ao mesmo tempo, ingratos com o que\nrecebem (já que tudo o que recebem é direito “inalienável”) e ressentidos quando\nnão recebem seus “direitos”. Não há saída para essa equação de geração de\npreguiça e mau caráter. E esses “direitos” custam caro. Quem paga a conta? Quem\ntrabalha, é claro. A minoria sempre carregou o mundo nas costas.\n\nO welfare state nega o fato de que poucos são mais capazes, mais inteligentes,\nmais esforçados e mais disciplinados e que por isso devem gozar dos resultados\ndas suas virtudes. Dizer isso é politicamente incorreto, mas é verdade.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnfim...\nA praga PC deve ser combatida não porque seja bonito dizer piadas racistas (não\né), mas porque ela é um instrumento de (maus) profissionais da cultura,\nnormalmente gente mau-caráter, fraca intelectualmente, pobre e oportunista, para\naniquilar o livre “comércio de ideias” ao seu redor, controlando as instâncias\nde razão pública, como universidades, escolas, jornais, revistas, rádio, TV e\ntribunais. Nascida da esquerda americana, ela é pior do que a esquerda clássica,\nporque essa pelo menos não era covarde. A praga PC usa métodos de coerção\ninstitucional e de assédio moral, visando calar todo mundo que discorda dela,\nantes de tudo, tentando fazer dessas pessoas monstros e, por fim, tentando\ninviabilizar o comércio livre de ideias. Ideias não são sempre coisas “boas”. Às\nvezes doem. Ao final, a praga PC é apenas mais uma forma enraivecida de recusar\na idade adulta e de aniquilar a inteligência. O que ela mais teme é a coragem.\nPor isso, diz que o povo é lindo quando não é, diz que as mulheres estão bem\nsozinhas, quando não estão (estavam mal acompanhadas e agora estão pior\nsozinhas, porque a humanidade é basicamente infeliz e incoerente com relação aos\ndesejos e às expectativas), diz que a natureza é uma mãe quando ela é mais\nMedeia, nos proíbe de reclamar de gente brega ao nosso redor, mente sobre\naqueles que lutaram contra a ditadura (eles não eram muito melhores do que os\ntorturadores se tivessem a chance de torturar alguém), nega a importância da\nculpa porque é mau-caráter, enfim, não é capaz de reconhecer valor em nada\nporque nega a própria capacidade humana de fazer discernimento.","feature_image":"/content/images/2016/08/pc.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2016-08-30 20:03:19","updated_at":"2016-08-30 21:01:36","published_at":"2016-07-17 20:10:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5baa33d40283b4635b8c9868","uuid":"8f7d9df5-e326-4b0b-850c-8d21c25796be","title":"How to read a Book","slug":"how-to-read-a-book","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"###1.

Quem são esses idiotas? Como reconhecê-los? O que eles costumam falar? Antes de tudo, **eles são maioria esmagadora e, como a democracia é um regime fundamentado na maioria, são vencedores pela simples força numérica**. A luta contra os idiotas é uma batalha perdida. Falam demais. Acreditam que, apenas porque têm boca, podem emitir opiniões sobre tudo. \\n\\nComo viraram engenheiros e médicos e professores, porque o “conhecimento” virou ferramenta de ascensão social, hoje os idiotas têm diplomas.\\n\\nMais um dos danos da sociedade do “acesso” em que todo mundo tem “acesso”, na qual quase não há conteúdos que valham qualquer “acesso”. **A maioria da humanidade sempre foi ignorante** (nascia, reproduzia e babava na gravata, como dizia Nelson), mas, com o advento da sensibilidade democrática para o número e a estatística, **essa maioria tomou a palavra**. Toda a “ética” democrática é voltada para a banalização do conhecimento a serviço da autoestima dos idiotas. Não os ofenda porque eles venceram.\\n\\nJá o filósofo espanhol Ortega y Gasset falava da miséria das massas nas universidades, transformadas em praças de técnicos que confundiam diploma com formação, fossem eles professores ou alunos.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nSegundo o que nos dizem os especialistas sobre o Renascimento, é nesse período que começa a surgir a ideia de que **todos somos indivíduos**. Movidos pelos avanços da ciência e pela ampliação da circulação dos livros, os burgueses, esses amantes da competência individual contra a herança aristocrática de sangue, pregam a virtude individual como experiência histórica total. De lá para cá, a moda de todo mundo ser indivíduo gerou, na realidade, grande inveja e ódio por quem de fato é indivíduo e suporta a solidão de sê-lo. Além do mais, a mídia e a arte vendem modelos de individualidade nas liquidações de material de autoajuda, infestando o mundo de idiotas ruidosos **enquanto os verdadeiros e infelizes indivíduos se escondem pelas florestas das cidades, como uma espécie caçada, em extinção**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Amor universal \\n\\nQuem diz que amar é querer “o bem de quem ama” é porque nunca amou. **Amar é querer o outro para si ou querer que o outro deixe de existir**. Isso é “querer comer” o outro. Respeitar a mulher, nesse caso, é entregá-la na mão de outro homem.

(John Barker sums up the enemy)\n\n\nIn fact, OOP gives us a vast graph of mutable objects, all of which can mutate\neach other, with a change in any one object possibly setting off a cascade of\nmutations that propagate out through the graph in ways that are often too\ncomplicated for the human mind to comprehend.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Favor composition over inheritance. (Joshua Bloch, in his book “Effective Java”)\n\n\nThe problems with inheritance, in OOP, have become clearer over time. It is\ntragic that OOP has had to retreat from such a powerful idea, to the extent that\ncomposition is now the favored strategy: Composition over inheritance (or\nComposite Reuse Principle) in object-oriented programming is a technique by\nwhich classes may achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by containing\nother classes that implement the desired functionality instead of through\ninheritance. Some languages, notably Go, use type composition exclusively.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost programming languages that I am aware of offer something like a struct or a \nrecord or an enum or a class — we can use these to enforce contracts. However,\nwhatever data structure we use, do we need the complexity that is apparent in\nChad Myers example? A simple record can give us contract-enforcement, but a\nclass comes with a whole extra set of baggage that programmers would be wise to\navoid. Please ask yourself what is really needed here.

Our current business operating system which is built around external, **carrot-and-stick motivators doesn't work and often does harm**. We need an upgrade. And the science shows the way. This new approach has three essential elements:\\n\\n* Autonomy the desire to direct our own lives; \\n* Mastery the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and \\n* Purpose the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs one leading behavioral science textbook puts it, **People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity.** This is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored.\\n\\nBut goals are more toxic than Motivation 2.0 recognizes. In fact, the business school professors suggest they should come with their own warning label: **Goals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased intrinsic motivation**. Use care when applying goals in your organization.\\n\\n**By offering a reward**, a principal signals to the agent that **the task is undesirable**. But that initial signal, and the reward that goes with it, **forces the principal onto a path that's difficult to leave**. Offer too small a reward and the agent won't comply.

Offer a rationale for **why the task is necessary**. A job that's not inherently interesting can become more meaningful, and therefore more engaging, if it's part of a larger purpose.\\n2. Acknowledge that **the task is boring**. This is an act of empathy, of course.

These faceless minions feared taking responsibility, craved security, and badly needed direction. As a result, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives. But McGregor said there was an alternative view of employees one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies. **This perspective held that taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest, that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility.**\\n\\nThe **Motivation 2.0** operating system depended on, and fostered, what I call **Type X** behavior. **Type X** behavior is fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones.\\n\\nThe **Motivation 3.0** operating system the upgrade that's needed to meet the new realities of how we organize, think about, and do what we do depends on what I call **Type I** behavior. **Type I** behavior is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones.

As a result, their focus inevitably veers from the output of their work (solving a client's problem) to its input (piling up as many hours as possible). **If the rewards come from time, then time is what firms will get.** These sorts of high-stakes, measurable goals can drain intrinsic motivation, sap individual initiative, and even encourage unethical behavior.\\n\\n> In the past, work was defined **primarily by putting in time**, and **secondarily on getting results**. We need to flip that model.\\n\\nOne source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what people can do. When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is **anxiety**. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is **boredom**.

But when the match is just right, the results can be glorious. **This is the essence of flow.**\\n\\n### Mastery\\n\\n**Type X** behavior often holds an entity theory of intelligence, prefers performance goals to learning goals, and **disdains effort as a sign of weakness**. **Type I** behavior has an incremental theory of intelligence, prizes learning goals over performance goals, and **welcomes effort as a way to improve** at something that matters. **Begin with one mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the other, and it can be inevitable.**\\n\\nThe mastery asymptote is a source of frustration. Why reach for something you can never fully attain? But it's also a source of allure.

It's because something flipped our default setting.\\n\\nA little kid's life bursts with autotelic experiences. Children careen from one flow moment to another, animated by a sense of joy, equipped with a mindset of possibility, and working with the dedication of a West Point cadet. **They use their brains and their bodies to probe and draw feedback from the environment in an endless pursuit of mastery.** Then at some point in their lives they don't. What happens? You start to get ashamed that what you're doing is childish[...]. What a mistake. **Perhaps you and I and all the other adults in charge of things are the ones who are immature.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nImagine an organization, for example, that believes in affirmative action one that wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse workforce. **By reducing ethics to a checklist**, suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn't discriminating. **Now the organization isn't focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off** to show that what it did is OK (and so it won't get sued). Before, its workers had an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing, but now they have an extrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn't get sued or fined.\\n\\n\\n### Remember that deliberate practice has one objective\\n\\nTo improve performance. People who play tennis once a week for years don't get any better if they do the same thing each time. **Deliberate practice is about changing your performance, setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time.**\\n\\n* Repeat, repeat, repeat. **Repetition matters.** Basketball greats don't shoot ten free throws at the end of team practice; they shoot five hundred. \\n* Seek constant, **critical feedback**. If you don't know how you're doing, you won't know what to improve. \\n* **Focus ruthlessly on where you need help.** Those who get better work on their weaknesses. \\n* Prepare for the process to be **mentally and physically exhausting**. ==That's why so few people commit to it, but that's why it works.==\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### External References\\n\\n* Even if unschooling is not for you or your kids, you can learn a thing or two from these educational innovators.

When what they must do exceeds their\ncapabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their\ncapabilities, the result is boredom. (Indeed, Csikszentmihalyi titled his first\nbook on autotelic experiences Beyond Boredom and Anxiety.) But when the match is\njust right, the results can be glorious. This is the essence of flow.\n\nMastery\nType X behavior often holds an entity theory of intelligence, prefers\nperformance goals to learning goals, and disdains effort as a sign of weakness. \nType I behavior has an incremental theory of intelligence, prizes learning goals\nover performance goals, and welcomes effort as a way to improve at something\nthat matters. Begin with one mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the\nother, and it can be inevitable.\n\nThe mastery asymptote is a source of frustration. Why reach for something you\ncan never fully attain? But it's also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? \nThe joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery\nattracts precisely because mastery eludes.\n\nThe immature one\nHave you ever seen a six-month-old or a one-year-old who's not curious and\nself-directed? That's how we are out of the box. If, at age fourteen or\nforty-three, we're passive and inert, that's not because it's our nature. It's\nbecause something flipped our default setting.\n\nA little kid's life bursts with autotelic experiences. Children careen from one\nflow moment to another, animated by a sense of joy, equipped with a mindset of\npossibility, and working with the dedication of a West Point cadet. They use\ntheir brains and their bodies to probe and draw feedback from the environment in\nan endless pursuit of mastery. Then at some point in their lives they don't.\nWhat happens? You start to get ashamed that what you're doing is childish[...].\nWhat a mistake. Perhaps you and I and all the other adults in charge of things\nare the ones who are immature.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine an organization, for example, that believes in affirmative action one\nthat wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse\nworkforce. By reducing ethics to a checklist, suddenly affirmative action is\njust a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it\nisn't discriminating. Now the organization isn't focused on affirmatively\npursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off \nto show that what it did is OK (and so it won't get sued). Before, its workers\nhad an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing, but now they have an\nextrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn't get sued or fined.\n\nRemember that deliberate practice has one objective\nTo improve performance. People who play tennis once a week for years don't get\nany better if they do the same thing each time. Deliberate practice is about\nchanging your performance, setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a\nbit higher each time.\n\n * Repeat, repeat, repeat. Repetition matters. Basketball greats don't shoot ten\n   free throws at the end of team practice; they shoot five hundred.\n * Seek constant, critical feedback. If you don't know how you're doing, you\n   won't know what to improve.\n * Focus ruthlessly on where you need help. Those who get better work on their\n   weaknesses.\n * Prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting. That's why\n   so few people commit to it, but that's why it works.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExternal References\n * Even if unschooling is not for you or your kids, you can learn a thing or two\n   from these educational innovators.

All these challenges lead us back to age-old problems. The almost theological political discussions of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries, which were like debates concerning the gender of angels, are being cast into oblivion. <strong>This return to ‘archaic’ (and hence fundamental) questions baffles ‘modern’ intellectuals, who expound on homosexuals’ right to get married and other such inanities.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, as foretold by philosopher Raymond Ruyer – someone hated by Leftist intellectuals – in his seminal works Les nuisances idéologiques and Les cents prochains siècles, when the historical period of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries will have come to a close, and its egalitarian hallucinations will have been sunk by catastrophe, humanity will revert to its archaic values, which are purely biological and human (i.e., anthropological):</p><ul><li>the separation of gender roles;</li><li>the transmission of ethnic and folk traditions, spirituality and priestly organisation;</li><li>visible and structuring social hierarchies;</li><li>the worship of ancestors;</li><li>rites and tests of initiation;</li><li>the re-establishment of organic communities (from the family to the folk);</li><li>the de-individualisation of marriage (unions must be the concern of the whole community and not merely of the married couple);</li><li>an end of the confusion between eroticism and conjugality;</li><li>the prestige of the warrior caste;</li><li>inequality among social statuses – not implicit inequality, which is unjust and frustrating and is what we find today in egalitarian utopias, but explicit and ideologically legitimated inequality;</li><li><strong>duties that match rights</strong>, hence a rigorous justice that gives people a sense of responsibility;</li><li>a definition of peoples – and of all established groups or bodies – as diachronic communities of destiny rather than synchronic masses of individual atoms.</li></ul><p><strong>Actually, these are the values of justice</strong>.

What we are dealing with here is not simply the usual brutalisation of the population via the increasingly sophisticated mass-media apparatus of the society of the spectacle – a veritable ‘audiovisual Prozac’ – but rather <strong>a concealment of essential political problems</strong> (immigration, pollution, transportation policies, the ageing of the population, the financial crisis of the social budgets expected to occur by 2010, etc.) <strong>through a constant discussion of superficial debates on secondary issues</strong>: homosexual marriage, PACS (‘Civil Pact of Solidarity’), gender equality among political candidates, doping in sports, the legalising of cannabis, etc.</p><p><strong>The focus on these insignificant problems prevents the discussion of urgent and crucial questions.</strong> Clearly, this is most convenient for a political class whose members are only interested in furthering their own careers and <em>‘avoid stirring the waters’</em>, according to the principle <em>‘after me, the deluge’</em>.</p><blockquote>Constantinople is under siege and we’re debating the gender of angels.</blockquote><h2 id=\"sports\">Sports</h2><p>On a global scale, sport has not only become an industry - a cause of widespread corruption, doping, and astronomical earnings – but it is also an essential part of showbiz. For this reason, <strong>as a new opium for the masses in a West lacking any religion, it fully contributes to the overall lobotomisation of society</strong>. The spectacle of sport infantilises consciences, conceals social problems and the failings of politics.</p><blockquote>France’s success in the last Football World Cup is a sensational example of this.

Has it served to create new jobs or prevent the flight of French brains to California? Has it strengthened the diplomatic and cultural standing of France in the world? Has multiethnic society shown itself to be superior to the monoethnic? The answer is no. Sport has simply been prostituted to lend credit to political lies.</p><hr><h2 id=\"pleasure-principle\">Pleasure principle</h2><p>A <strong>society founded on order</strong> is perfectly capable of integrating parallel practices which only concern a minority of people. This is not a matter of being tolerant or lax, but of adopting an organic approach.</p><p><strong>In an organic perspective two opposite principles can co-exist</strong>: the fertile and traditional family and deviances, the mother and the prostitute, the serene hearth and the debauchery of the brothel – all within a hierarchical order. The homosexual lobby and intellectual Left are implicitly attacking the family model and the female role of the housewife, often giving proof of incredible hatred and intolerance. Conservatives, on the other hand, who have a mistaken and fossilised view of ‘tradition’, always take a puritanical stance.</p><p>The ‘pleasure principle’ must be tolerated and hypocritically managed – for it is human and inextinguishable – yet without allowing it to become the dominating norm and become an order in itself. It should exist subordinately, surrounded by ‘social silence’.</p><blockquote>Does this constitute an apology of lies and hypocrisy? Well, yes. <strong>Have you ever seen human societies founded on transparency? Generally, they lead to totalitarianism.</strong> Brothels should be reopened.</blockquote><p><strong>To put heterosexual couples, which perpetuate the population</strong>, and homosexual couples (whether male or female) on the same level<strong> is a sign of the pathological exasperation of individualism.</strong> It means mistaking desires for rights. It means scorning the collective interest and riding roughshod over common sense, a notion with which the French Left – the most stupid Left in the world – has been in conflict ever since 1789 thanks to its ideological hallucinations.</p><h2 id=\"education-politics\">Education &amp; politics</h2><p>The same is happening with parents’ education of their children. This is also <strong>failing because it is based on the blissful adulation of one’s offspring</strong> (these by-products of love), which undermines the legitimacy and authority of parents, perceived as loving sheep.</p><p>Politicians are similarly <strong>doomed to failure because their ideology and actions are marred by residues of love</strong> – good feelings, do-goodism, humanitarianism, pity, masochism, and a misdirected and hypocritical altruism – instead of resting on the decision-making will of pursuing one’s goal to the very end, whatever the cost.</p><blockquote>This civilisation, which has long been implicitly founded on the distorted notion of love, must one day return to the allegory of Don Juan, the symbol of anti-love par excellence.</blockquote><p><strong>The rejection of school and university selectivity</strong>, which aimed at replacing equality of results with equal opportunities, by a heterotelic effect, <strong>brought less social justice</strong>. The results, thirty years after the introduction of this perverse principle (‘orientation replacing selection’), are:</p><ul><li>a depreciation of diplomas, which contributes to unemployment;</li><li>a flight of brains towards Anglo-Saxon universities;</li><li>a general worsening of teaching and a growth in illiteracy;</li><li>the end of school as a place of competition and education, and its partial transformation into an unbearable jungle;</li><li>the creation of a two-tier school system: one private, qualified and selective for the rich, and one public and under-qualified for the poor.</li></ul><p>Paradoxically, the egalitarian opposition to selectivity launched in May ’68 is one of the causes of the present ‘exclusion’.</p><p>By contrast, worthless BAs and junk diplomas in ‘psycho-sociologies’ or ‘aesthetics’ are handed out like sweets or leaflets to rows of good-for-nothings who will queue up at social security offices to get underpaid jobs as switchboard operators, pizza boys, or waiters at McDonald’s.</p><blockquote>This is the outcome of <strong>demagogy and egalitarian ideology</strong>, which rejects reality and ignores – and has been ignoring for a while – social mechanisms.</blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"fighting-back\">Fighting back</h3><p>Only when on the brink of disaster – when economic hedonism has come to an end – will the European peoples find the strength to react against what awaits them. <strong>No effective solutions can be expected prior to the unleashing of the catastrophe</strong> that will most likely take place. People’s power to resist has been sapped by consumerism, comfort, and the countless ‘commodities’ of the society of the spectacle. People are weakened by the slack life they lead, by their boundless individualism, by the dreams promoted via television and advertising, and by their virtual experiences. This is what the anthropologist Arnold Gehlen has termed ‘second-hand experiences’ – socio-economic opium. <strong>Societies based on conspicuous consumption</strong> – as Thorstein Veblen noted in the early Twentieth century – <strong>have undermined their own economic and social foundations</strong>. They have destroyed their own dreams of freedom, emancipation, equality, justice and prosperity by pushing them to their very limit, to the absurd, so that by a boomerang effect these societies are no longer capable of resisting financial crises, criminal organisations, and the social upheavals they have caused. This is an example of the dialectical reversal that Marx and Jules Monnerot have described.</p><blockquote>These societies have caused a <strong>global anthropological weakening</strong>, whereby all the immune defences of humanity are collapsing. <strong>The cure can only be a radical and painful one.</strong> We are heading towards a revolution that will make the Russian one seem like a brawl in comparison.</blockquote><h3 id=\"justice-of-the-future\">Justice of the future</h3><p>Everyone is talking of ‘the failure of the educational system’ and of ‘violence in schools’, but these are only the fruits of a system that <strong>opposes selectivity and discipline in the name of utopias</strong> it wishes to preserve like dogmas.</p><p><strong>Selection and discipline</strong>: these archaic but effective principles are the basis of true individual freedom – the social justice of the future. Today, instead of striving to rebuild things, it might be better to leave the educational system to collapse completely, given its inability to accomplish its task and the state’s utter lack of interest in the matter. The new state that will emerge in the post-catastrophic world may take things in hand again.</p><h2 id=\"the-left-\">The left...</h2><p>The Left came up with PACS not so much because it sought to win the favours of the homosexual lobby, but because it made the following reasoning: our ‘progressivism’ is moribund, and we’re no longer able to pursue social justice in any concrete way; the struggle against unemployment and poverty is beyond us. The only solution for the Left, then, is hypocritical progressivism. Hence the idea of PACS, which like other <strong>pseudo-humanitarian measures</strong> – such as the regularisation of illegal immigrants – brings not an ounce of good to the people, but only increases the burden on everyone’s shoulders.</p><p>The whole PACS affair illustrates the spinelessness and impotence of governments in this declining democracy of ours. <strong>The process is always the same. Incapable of solving concrete problems, governments feed public opinion abstract reforms that are always justified as further acts of humanitarianism and tolerance.</strong></p><blockquote>All this is happening because the latter dogmatically refuses to acknowledge the inequality in skills among different individuals and ethnic groups. ‘Nature’ does not share our views? Then let us change nature by decree, as is done with history!</blockquote><p><strong>Actually, the Left has long abandoned the social sphere. Today, it seeks refuge in ‘ethics’ – a new fraud.</strong> It no longer cares about ‘defending the oppressed’, except in a pretend way; actually, it never did: the Marxist-Trotskyist tradition has always taken little notice of the ‘working class’ and ‘proletarians’ – and ‘immigrants’ today – whom it continues to treat as masses to be manipulated to stir up social chaos in the hope that its cynical and ambitious (as well as perfectly ‘anti-Republican’) circles may one day come into power for good. <strong>Unfortunately, it is not enough to merely seize power: power must also be preserved.</strong> With its pseudo-moral strategy, the Left and far Left have been playing with fire while forgetting the joker: Islam.</p><h3 id=\"environmentalism\">Environmentalism</h3><p>Political environmentalism, as shown by Greenpeace campaigns, <strong>is a large-scale fraud</strong>. Like many charitable, humanitarian and cultural associations, it is only one of the countless disguises the political far Left uses to move its pawns and compensate for its notable lack of any alternative socio-economic project.</p><h2 id=\"immigration\">Immigration</h2><p>Why do all Leftists favour immigration? Why is it that the more people are to the Left, the more they welcome unrestrained immigration? The reasons invoked are both sophistic and ridiculous:</p><p>[...] political psychoanalysis would reveal that these people regard the ‘White man’ as being intrinsically guilty and stained by the unforgettable and unpardonable sin of having exploited non-European peoples (through colonialism, racism, etc.). <strong>Immigrationism and theories promoting the idea of a multiracial, mixed society thus represent the work of being redeemed for our sins.</strong> We must make up for our faults by disappearing as a homogeneous folk and allowing ourselves to be colonised and dominated.</p><p>The self-righteous advocates of political correctness find themselves caught in an ideological trap: fighting the idea of national preference while emphatically defending ‘citizenship’ (or embracing ‘French’ patriotism and the idea of France) will prove an increasingly difficult acrobatic feat. On the other hand, the Left is being forced to confess its hidden thought: that a Senegalese enjoys all the rights of France, but a Frenchman enjoys none in Senegal. This disregard for common sense can’t go on for long.</p><hr><h2 id=\"progress\">Progress</h2><blockquote>‘Progress’ is clearly a dying idea, even if economic growth may be continuing.</blockquote><p>Yet, no one is really deriving the right conclusions from this. People no longer believe that ‘tomorrow will be better than today, just as today is better than yesterday’ thanks to technological and scientific advancements and the alleged educational and moral improvement of humanity – the dogma promoted by Auguste Comte and the French positivists – as well as the spread of ‘democracy’.</p><blockquote>Evidence is mounting that ‘growth’, this measurable mockery, does not actually lead to any objective increase in well-being.</blockquote><p>[...] for technological science and the industrial market economy cannot be abandoned, as they are too rooted and already in the process of becoming global. <strong>But the idea of universally extending industrial society to all individual humans will have to be ditched</strong>, for it is unsustainable in terms of energy, health and the environment.</p><h3 id=\"multiracist-society\">Multiracist society</h3><p>Can people simply be mixed together, as a cook would mix his vegetables to make a salad? We should not hesitate to speak up against the crypto-racist ideology of the partisans of unchecked mass immigration. <strong>Immigrationist lobbies are perfectly aware of the fact that multiracial society means multiracist society</strong>: something that has already been noted many times in the present work but which it is worth stressing again and again.</p><blockquote>Only Europe and North America are being subjected to immigration. Only Europe and North America – or, rather, their intelligentsias – believe and make others believe in the inevitability of a global melting-pot.</blockquote><p>Now, globalisation and immigration do not concern the rest of the world.

We are heading towards a revolution that will make the Russian one\nseem like a brawl in comparison.Justice of the future\nEveryone is talking of ‘the failure of the educational system’ and of ‘violence\nin schools’, but these are only the fruits of a system that opposes selectivity\nand discipline in the name of utopias  it wishes to preserve like dogmas.\n\nSelection and discipline: these archaic but effective principles are the basis\nof true individual freedom – the social justice of the future. Today, instead of\nstriving to rebuild things, it might be better to leave the educational system\nto collapse completely, given its inability to accomplish its task and the\nstate’s utter lack of interest in the matter. The new state that will emerge in\nthe post-catastrophic world may take things in hand again.\n\nThe left...\nThe Left came up with PACS not so much because it sought to win the favours of\nthe homosexual lobby, but because it made the following reasoning: our\n‘progressivism’ is moribund, and we’re no longer able to pursue social justice\nin any concrete way; the struggle against unemployment and poverty is beyond us.\nThe only solution for the Left, then, is hypocritical progressivism. Hence the\nidea of PACS, which like other pseudo-humanitarian measures  – such as the\nregularisation of illegal immigrants – brings not an ounce of good to the\npeople, but only increases the burden on everyone’s shoulders.\n\nThe whole PACS affair illustrates the spinelessness and impotence of governments\nin this declining democracy of ours. The process is always the same. Incapable\nof solving concrete problems, governments feed public opinion abstract reforms\nthat are always justified as further acts of humanitarianism and tolerance.\n\nAll this is happening because the latter dogmatically refuses to acknowledge the\ninequality in skills among different individuals and ethnic groups. ‘Nature’\ndoes not share our views? Then let us change nature by decree, as is done with\nhistory!Actually, the Left has long abandoned the social sphere. Today, it seeks\nrefuge in ‘ethics’ – a new fraud.  It no longer cares about ‘defending the\noppressed’, except in a pretend way; actually, it never did: the\nMarxist-Trotskyist tradition has always taken little notice of the ‘working\nclass’ and ‘proletarians’ – and ‘immigrants’ today – whom it continues to treat\nas masses to be manipulated to stir up social chaos in the hope that its cynical\nand ambitious (as well as perfectly ‘anti-Republican’) circles may one day come\ninto power for good. Unfortunately, it is not enough to merely seize power:\npower must also be preserved.  With its pseudo-moral strategy, the Left and far\nLeft have been playing with fire while forgetting the joker: Islam.\n\nEnvironmentalism\nPolitical environmentalism, as shown by Greenpeace campaigns, is a large-scale\nfraud. Like many charitable, humanitarian and cultural associations, it is only\none of the countless disguises the political far Left uses to move its pawns and\ncompensate for its notable lack of any alternative socio-economic project.\n\nImmigration\nWhy do all Leftists favour immigration? Why is it that the more people are to\nthe Left, the more they welcome unrestrained immigration? The reasons invoked\nare both sophistic and ridiculous:\n\n[...] political psychoanalysis would reveal that these people regard the ‘White\nman’ as being intrinsically guilty and stained by the unforgettable and\nunpardonable sin of having exploited non-European peoples (through colonialism,\nracism, etc.). Immigrationism and theories promoting the idea of a multiracial,\nmixed society thus represent the work of being redeemed for our sins.  We must\nmake up for our faults by disappearing as a homogeneous folk and allowing\nourselves to be colonised and dominated.\n\nThe self-righteous advocates of political correctness find themselves caught in\nan ideological trap: fighting the idea of national preference while emphatically\ndefending ‘citizenship’ (or embracing ‘French’ patriotism and the idea of\nFrance) will prove an increasingly difficult acrobatic feat. On the other hand,\nthe Left is being forced to confess its hidden thought: that a Senegalese enjoys\nall the rights of France, but a Frenchman enjoys none in Senegal. This disregard\nfor common sense can’t go on for long.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProgress\n‘Progress’ is clearly a dying idea, even if economic growth may be continuing.\nYet, no one is really deriving the right conclusions from this. People no longer\nbelieve that ‘tomorrow will be better than today, just as today is better than\nyesterday’ thanks to technological and scientific advancements and the alleged\neducational and moral improvement of humanity – the dogma promoted by Auguste\nComte and the French positivists – as well as the spread of ‘democracy’.\n\nEvidence is mounting that ‘growth’, this measurable mockery, does not actually\nlead to any objective increase in well-being.[...] for technological science and\nthe industrial market economy cannot be abandoned, as they are too rooted and\nalready in the process of becoming global. But the idea of universally extending\nindustrial society to all individual humans will have to be ditched, for it is\nunsustainable in terms of energy, health and the environment.\n\nMultiracist society\nCan people simply be mixed together, as a cook would mix his vegetables to make\na salad? We should not hesitate to speak up against the crypto-racist ideology\nof the partisans of unchecked mass immigration. Immigrationist lobbies are\nperfectly aware of the fact that multiracial society means multiracist society:\nsomething that has already been noted many times in the present work but which\nit is worth stressing again and again.\n\nOnly Europe and North America are being subjected to immigration. Only Europe\nand North America – or, rather, their intelligentsias – believe and make others\nbelieve in the inevitability of a global melting-pot.Now, globalisation and\nimmigration do not concern the rest of the world. It is an intellectual\ndeception to argue that globalisation is a world-wide phenomenon reflecting the\ncourse of history.","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/09/Faye-1024x499.png","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-09-25 13:39:41","updated_at":"2018-09-25 16:20:14","published_at":"2018-07-11 14:29:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5be04618f60cd42fb8a5ae20","uuid":"d3408b30-ff5d-4ebe-99ee-e19123292f20","title":"The replication crisis","slug":"he-replication-crisis","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[],0,\"There are 1 million scientific publications per year.
