We’ve learned that bias is a disease and to fight it we need a healthy treatment of facts and education. We find that when facts are injected into the conversation, the symptoms of bias become less severe. But, unfortunately, we’ve also learned that facts can only do so much.

“When there are too many physician-patient interactions, the amplitude gets turned up on everything,” he says. “More people with nonfatal problems are taking more medications and having more procedures, many of which are not really helpful and a few of which are harmful, while the people with really fatal illnesses are rarely cured and ultimately die anyway.” So it may be that going to the hospital slightly increases your odds of surviving if you’ve got a serious problem but increases your odds of dying if you don’t.

From 2002 to 2008, the United States was fighting bloody wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; among active military personnel, there were an average 1,643 fatalities per year. But over the same stretch of time in the early 1980s, with the United States fighting no major wars, there were more than 2,100 military deaths per year. How can this possibly be?

the accidental death rate for soldiers in the early 1980s was higher than the death rate by hostile fire for every year the United States has been fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seems that practicing to fight a war can be just about as dangerous as really fighting one. And, to further put things in perspective, think about this: since 1982, some 42,000 active U.S. military personnel have been killed—roughly the same number of Americans who die in traffic accidents in a single year.

“A doubling of carbon dioxide traps less than 2 percent of the outgoing radiation emitted by the earth,” he says. Furthermore, atmospheric carbon dioxide is governed by the law of diminishing returns: each gigaton added to the air has less radiative impact than the previous one. Caldeira mentions a study he undertook that considered the impact of higher carbon-dioxide levels on plant life. While plants get their water from the soil, they get their food—carbon dioxide, that is—from the air.

Although a widespread conversion to solar power might seem appealing, the reality is tricky. The energy consumed by building the thousands of new solar plants necessary to replace coal-burning and other power plants would create a huge long-term “warming debt,” as Myhrvold calls it. “Eventually, we’d have a great carbon-free energy infrastructure but only after making emissions and global warming worse every year until we’re done building out the solar plants, which could take thirty to fifty years.”

When a doctor fails to wash his hands, his own life isn’t the one that is primarily endangered. It is the next patient he treats, the one with the open wound or the compromised immune system. The dangerous bacteria that patient receives are a negative externality of the doctor’s actions—just as pollution is a negative externality of anyone who drives a car, jacks up the air conditioner, or sends coal exhaust up a smokestack. The polluter has insufficient incentive to not pollute, and the doctor has insufficient incentive to wash his hands. This is what makes the science of behavior change so difficult.

A invasão politicamente correta nos estudos sobre a queda de Roma acabou embaralhando verdades óbvias sobre a época: a de que o Império Romano foi uma civilização excepcional e o seu fim foi um desastre total para os europeus. A prova mais evidente dessa decadência é o fato de não haver na Europa, no começo da Idade Média, monumentos, palácios, obras literárias e cerâmicas tão sofisticadas quanto as do auge do Império Romano. Mas há muitas outras.

Bordéis parisienses costumavam dar nome ao logradouro em que estavam instalados, por isso há nos mapas antigos de Paris endereços do tipo rue Petit et du Gros-Cul (“Rua da Pequena e Grande Bunda”), Gratte-cul (“Coçador de bunda”), Poil-au-Com (“Boceta cabeluda”). Séculos depois, esses nomes foram trocados para formas mais pudicas, mas muitos deles mantiveram a fonética original.

“É uma distorção dos fatos dizer que as fábricas arrancaram as donas de casa de seus lares ou as crianças de seus brinquedos”, conta Ludwig von Mises, um dos maiores economistas do século 20.97 “Os proprietários das fábricas não tinham poder para obrigar ninguém a aceitar um emprego nas suas empresas. Podiam apenas contratar pessoas que quisessem trabalhar pelos salários que lhes eram oferecidos. Mesmo que esses salários fossem baixos, ainda assim eram muito mais do que aqueles indigentes poderiam ganhar em qualquer outro lugar. Aquelas mulheres não tinham como alimentar os seus filhos. Aquelas crianças estavam carentes e famintas. Seu único refúgio era a fábrica; que as salvou, no estrito senso do termo, de morrer de fome.”

A Revolução Industrial fez tão bem aos pobres que muitos aristocratas ficaram indignados com ela. Até o século 18, era possível saber facilmente se alguém era nobre de acordo com as roupas, o peso e a altura. A popularização do consumo de açúcar, roupas, móveis, relógios, couro, tapetes e tabaco teve um dramático efeito social: tornou difícil distinguir aristocratas de burgueses e novos-ricos sem sobrenome.

O erro da ideia de que as máquinas roubam empregos é achar que os desejos humanos, e os empregos para satisfazer esses desejos, são finitos. Desse ponto de vista, se uma máquina tira a função de um artesão, não vai sobrar outra atividade para sustentá-lo. Quem primeiro espalhou esse equívoco foi Karl Marx. “O instrumento de trabalho, quando toma a forma de uma máquina, se torna imediatamente um concorrente do operário. A expansão do capital por meio da máquina está na razão direta do número de trabalhadores cujas condições de existência ela destrói”,120 escreveu ele.

Mas nem todos os efeitos da Revolução Industrial são positivos. Se é verdade que o capitalismo fez luxuosidades chegarem ao dia a dia dos pobres, tornou o trabalho infantil desnecessário e transformou a fome em problema de abundância ele também gerou consequências menos satisfatórias. Uma delas foi a proliferação dos intelectuais. Ao libertar as pessoas do trabalho do campo e dar força a indústrias de entretenimento, a Revolução Industrial multiplicou o número de indivíduos que poderiam se dar ao luxo de passar a vida em bibliotecas e escolas discutindo ideias – e reclamando (que grande ironia) dos terríveis efeitos do capitalismo.

Com a aproximação da Primeira Guerra, em 1914, Mussolini rompeu com os socialistas italianos contrários à participação da Itália no conflito e aderiu a uma dissidência chamada Fascio Autonomi d’Azione Rivoluzionaria, da qual surgiria o Partido Fascista. Nacionalistas, os militantes dessa nova facção declararam guerra ao socialismo internacional. E, assim, o fascismo ficou para a história como o maior inimigo da União Soviética. No entanto, Mussolini e seus novos adversários seguiram compartilhando antigas crenças e bandeiras. “Sou e permanecerei um socialista, e minhas convicções nunca mudarão. Elas estão gravadas em meus próprios ossos”, escreveu ele pouco antes de ser expulso do Partido Socialista italiano.

Em 1927, Mussolini impôs a Carta del Lavoro, que instituiu na Itália a justiça do trabalho e as normas de adicional para trabalho noturno, descanso semanal e férias anuais. Esse conjunto de leis também é um marco do corporativismo, ou seja, a participação dos cidadãos na política por meio das suas associações profissionais. A Carta del Lavoro foi copiada por diversos países, como Portugal, Turquia e Brasil. Como é bem conhecido, Getúlio Vargas se inspirou nessa e em outras leis para criar a Constituição de 1937, que instituiu o Estado Novo. Diversos trechos do código brasileiro são pura tradução da carta de Mussolini. É menos conhecido o fato de que, com o fim da Segunda Guerra, o Brasil foi um dos poucos países a manter o trabalhismo fascista. “O regime corporativo desapareceu na Itália, em Portugal, na Espanha”, diz o professor de direito Arion Sayão Romita, no livro O Fascismo no Direito do Trabalho Brasileiro. “A nova organização democrática desses países revogou toda a legislação corporativa, eliminou todos os institutos criados pelo regime anterior; todavia, isso não se deu no Brasil, apesar da alteração dos regimes políticos, ocorrida em 1945.”

Esse sistema se fundamentava na visão de mundo dos tibetanos. Eles acreditavam em carma e reencarnação. Qualquer penúria nesta vida seria uma punição pelas más ações cometidas em vidas passadas. O sofrimento, portanto, não vinha da opressão dos aristocratas ou do governo, mas de um castigo divino por atos em vidas pregressas, dos quais o culpado não fazia a menor ideia. Para se livrar do carma e ter mais sorte na vida seguinte, o melhor caminho era aceitar o destino e ser obediente.

os jovens da União Soviética pirateavam discos LP. O governo censurava boa parte das músicas do mundo capitalista – Kiss, Julio Iglesias e Pink Floyd, por exemplo, eram considerados propaganda neofascista. Para escapar da censura, alguém teve a ideia de imprimir LPs em radiografias médicas (na época mais espessas que as atuais). Nasceu assim um intenso mercado negro de música dos anos 60 a 80. Os LPs clandestinos ganharam o nome “rock nas costelas” ou “jazz em ossos”, já que preservavam a imagem de costelas, bacias e colunas vertebrais das radiografias.

much of the world, poverty is no longer absolute, a lack of food, shelter, or clothing; it is relative. Its miseries are no longer those of raw physical deprivation but those induced by comparison with the vast numbers of prosperous people by whom the relatively poor are surrounded and whose comparative wealth the poor feel as a wound, a reproach, and an injustice.

They achieved a rate of slaughter with their machetes never equalled even by the Nazis with their gas chambers. Who now would bet heavily against such a thing ever happening again anywhere in the world?

John Maynard Keynes wrote, in a famous passage in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, that practical men might not have much time for theoretical considerations, but in fact the world is governed by little else than the outdated or defunct ideas of economists and social philosophers. I agree: except that I would now add novelists, playwrights, film directors, journalists, artists, and even pop singers. They are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, and we ought to pay close attention to what they say and how they say it.

A ridiculous pas de deux between doctor and patient ensues: the patient pretends to be ill, and the doctor pretends to cure him. In the process, the patient is wilfully blinded to the conduct that inevitably causes his misery in the first place. I have therefore come to see that one of the most important tasks of the doctor today is the disavowal of his own power and responsibility. The patient’s notion that he is ill stands in the way of his understanding of the situation, without which moral change cannot take place. The doctor who pretends to treat is an obstacle to this change, blinding rather than enlightening.

The existence of malnutrition in the midst of plenty has not entirely escaped either the intelligentsia or the government, which of course is proposing measures to combat it: but, as usual, neither pols nor pundits wish to look the problem in the face or make the obvious connections. For them, the real and most pressing question raised by any social problem is: ‘How do I appear concerned and compassionate to all my friends, colleagues, and peers?’ Needless to say, the first imperative is to avoid any hint of blaming the victim by examining the bad choices that he makes. It is not even permissible to look at the reasons for those choices, since by definition victims are victims and therefore not responsible for their acts, unlike the relatively small class of human beings who are not victims.

This is how the British government’s current Food Poverty Eradication Bill should be interpreted. By attempting to tackle the sources of supply rather than those of demand, it will sidestep the question of an entire way of life—a problem that it would take genuine moral courage to tackle—and aim at an easy target instead. The government will increase bureaucracy and regulation without reducing malnutrition. This, in miniature, is the story of modern Britain.

And when, having returned from a country in which half the population has been displaced and the infrastructure entirely destroyed, I hear complaints about the difficulty of finding taxis in the rain or delays in delivery of the mail, I am apt to grow disdainful. The problem with having lived too long or too frequently in dangerous situations is that one ceases to care very much about the actual content of the existence one is so anxious to preserve. Danger absolves one of the need to deal with a hundred quotidian problems or to make a thousand little choices, each one unimportant. Danger simplifies existence and therefore—again when chosen, not imposed—comes as a relief from many anxieties.

Looking around me in the township, I began to see that the spotlessly clean white uniform in which she appeared every day in the hospital represented not an absurd fetish, not the brutal imposition of alien cultural standards upon African life, but a noble triumph of the human spirit—as, indeed, did her tenderly cared-for home. By comparison with her struggle to maintain herself in decency, my former rejection of bourgeois proprieties and respectability seemed to me ever afterward to be shallow, trivial, and adolescent. Until then, I had assumed, along with most of my generation unacquainted with real hardship, that a scruffy appearance was a sign of spiritual election, representing a rejection of the superficiality and materialism of bourgeois life. Ever since then, however, I have not been able to witness the voluntary adoption of torn, worn out, and tattered clothes—at least in public—by those in a position to dress otherwise without a feeling of deep disgust. Far from being a sign of solidarity with the poor, it is a perverse mockery of them; it is spitting on the graves of our ancestors, who struggled so hard, so long, and so bitterly that we might be warm, clean, well-fed, and leisured enough to enjoy the better things in life.

I took with me instead a work by a nineteenth-century French aristocrat, the Marquis de Custine. First published as a series of letters in 1843 under the title La Russie en 1839, the book has since appeared in a multiplicity of formats and abbreviated versions, with various titles in English, suggesting that even its translators and most fervent admirers do not consider it a flawless work of literary art. And yet this travel book is undoubtedly a masterpiece, a work of such penetration and prescience that it is worth reading more than a century and a half after its composition, not only for its antiquarian or historical interest but because of the incomparably brilliant light it sheds on one of the most important phenomena of the last hundred years: the spread of communism throughout the world.

Visitors reached the palace by boat from Saint Petersburg, and one boat had sunk in a storm on the way to the festival with the loss of all its passengers and crew. But because ‘any mishap [in Russia] is treated as an affair of State’ in Russia, and because ‘to lie is to protect the social order, to speak the truth is to destroy the State,’ there followed ‘a silence more terrifying than the disaster itself.’ In Russia, people of the highest social class—as were the boat’s passengers—could disappear not only without a trace but without comment. Who in such a country could ever feel safe?

Custine appreciated only too well the violence that this remaking of history did to the minds of men, and the consequences it had for their character and behaviour. In order not to look at the palace in which the emperor Paul was murdered, a person had to know that he was killed there; but his whole purpose in not looking at the palace was to demonstrate in public his ignorance of the murder. He thus had not only to assert a lie but also to deny that he knew it was a lie. And all officials—the emperor included—had likewise to pretend that they did not know they were being lied to, or else the whole edifice of falsehood would have come tumbling down. The need always to lie and always to avoid the truth stripped everyone of what Custine called ‘the two greatest gifts of God—the soul and the speech which communicates it.’ People became hypocritical, cunning, mistrustful, cynical, silent, cruel, and indifferent to the fate of others as a result of the destruction of their own souls.

But it was from this initial identity of interest that a potential danger arose. By small degrees—though this was only a possibility, not an inevitability—men might cede their independence to a government that represented them, that was believed to have their interests at heart, and that was (after all) composed of men very like themselves. In a passage that united prophetic with psychological insight, Tocqueville (who rightly foresaw that democratic government was destined to spread widely, if not throughout the entire world) described the future soul of man under a seemingly benevolent and democratic government that willingly laboured for the happiness of the people ‘but chose to be the sole agent and only arbiter of that happiness.’ Such a government would ‘supply [the people] with their necessities, facilitate their pleasures, manage their principal concerns.’ What would remain, but to ‘spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living’? When this came to pass, ‘the will of man will not be shattered, but softened, bent and guided.’ Men will not be forced to act, but prevented from acting; the government will not destroy, but prevent a full human existence. It will not tyrannise, but ‘enervate, extinguish and stupefy a people.’ And this is exactly the condition to which a part of the population had been reduced under irreproachably democratic governments. Living in subsidised housing, its children educated free of charge and its medical bills paid (all for its own good, of course), with an income sufficient to guarantee both enough food and perpetual entertainment in the form of television, all its ‘principal concerns’ are ‘managed,’ just as Tocqueville said they would be, and it is thus spared ‘the care of thinking and all the trouble of living.’

For I work among people who are in effect paupers: and Tocqueville understood, as few modern writers do, that pauperism is above all a psychological, not an economic, condition. And he saw in the English system of social assistance to the poor the same insidious threat to men’s independence of character that he saw, only as a potentiality, in American democracy.

The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails—neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind. In such cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking. This is the slow thinking of the title. Fast thinking includes both variants of intuitive thought—the expert and the heuristic—as well as the entirely automatic mental activities of perception and memory, the operations that enable you to know there is a lamp on your desk or retrieve the name of the capital of Russia.

Some years ago, the psychologist Timothy Wilson wrote a book with the evocative title Strangers to Ourselves. You have now been introduced to that stranger in you, which may be in control of much of what you do, although you rarely have a glimpse of it. System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present with the recent past and with expectations about the near future. It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. And it does most of this without your conscious awareness of its activities. System 1 is also, as we will see in the following chapters, the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions.

To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. This rule is part of good police procedure. When there are multiple witnesses to an event, they are not allowed to discuss it before giving their testimony. The goal is not only to prevent collusion by hostile witnesses, it is also to prevent unbiased witnesses from influencing each other. Witnesses who exchange their experiences will tend to make similar errors in their testimony, reducing the total value of the information they provide. Eliminating redundancy from your sources of information is always a good idea.

The principle of independent judgments (and decorrelated errors) has immediate applications for the conduct of meetings, an activity in which executives in organizations spend a great deal of their working days. A simple rule can help: before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position. This procedure makes good use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the group. The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.

They have denied the distinction between higher and lower, to the invariable advantage of the latter. They have denied the superiority of man’s greatest cultural achievements over the most ephemeral and vulgar of entertainments; they have denied that the scientific labours of brilliant men have resulted in an objective understanding of Nature, and, like Pilate, they have treated the question of truth as a jest; above all, they have denied that it matters how people conduct themselves in their personal lives, provided only that they consent to their own depravity.

The philosophic argument is that, in a free society, adults should be permitted to do whatever they please, always provided that they are prepared to take the consequences of their own choices and that they cause no direct harm to others. The locus classicus for this point of view is John Stuart Mill’s famous essay On Liberty: ‘The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of the community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others,’ Mill wrote. ‘His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.’ This radical individualism allows society no part whatever in shaping, determining, or enforcing a moral code: in short, we have nothing in common but our contractual agreement not to interfere with one another as we go about seeking our private pleasures.

And so long as the demand for material goods outstrips supply, people will be tempted to commit criminal acts against the owners of property. This is not an argument, in my view, against private property or in favour of the common ownership of all goods. It does suggest, however, that we shall need a police force for a long time to come.

In claiming that prohibition, not the drugs themselves, is the problem, Nadelmann and many others—even policemen—have said that ‘the war on drugs is lost.’ But to demand a yes or no answer to the question ‘Is the war against drugs being won?’ is like demanding a yes or no answer to the question ‘Have you stopped beating your wife yet?’ Never can an unimaginative and fundamentally stupid metaphor have exerted a more baleful effect upon proper thought. Let us ask whether medicine is winning the war against death. The answer is obviously no, it isn’t winning: the one fundamental rule of human existence remains, unfortunately, one man one death.

But who, one might ask, had the deeper and subtler moral understanding of human relations: the audience of the mid-1950s or that of today? To the 1950s audience it would have been unnecessary to point out that, once a child had been conceived, the father owed a duty not only to the child, but to the mother; that his own wishes in the matter were not paramount, let alone all-important, and that he was not simply an individual but a member of a society whose expectations he had to meet if he were to retain its respect; and that a sense of moral obligation toward a woman was not inimical to a satisfying relationship with her but a precondition of it. To the present-day audience, by contrast, the only considerations in such a situation would be the individual inclinations of the parties involved, floating free of all moral or social constraints. In the modern view, unbridled personal freedom is the only good to be pursued; any obstacle to it is a problem to be overcome.

IN THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORLDVIEW to which all good liberals subscribe, there is no evil, only victimhood. The robber and the robbed, the murderer and the murdered, are alike the victims of circumstance, united by the events that overtook them. Future generations (I hope) will find it curious how, in the century of Stalin and Hitler, we have been so eager to deny man’s capacity for evil. Every now and again, however, a case arises that stirs a faint memory of this capacity—forgotten soon afterward.

The social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling, has been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society. It is useful to remember, however, that neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments. Resistance to stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that the resistance is costless is wrong. The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society, but denying that the costs exist, while satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically defensible. Reliance on the affect heuristic is common in politically charged arguments. The positions we favor have no cost and those we oppose have no benefits. We should be able to do better.

After several years in Africa, I concluded that the colonial enterprise had been fundamentally wrong and mistaken, even when, as was often the case in its final stages, it was benevolently intended. The good it did was ephemeral; the harm, lasting. The powerful can change the powerless, it is true; but not in any way they choose. The unpredictability of humans is the revenge of the powerless. What emerges politically from the colonial enterprise is often something worse, or at least more vicious because better equipped, than what existed before. Good intentions are certainly no guarantee of good results.

Remember these qualifications when using the mantra: It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together. It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it! It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet.

Reframing is effortful and System 2 is normally lazy. Unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise, most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are frame-bound rather than reality-bound.

Decisions that do not produce the best possible experience and erroneous forecasts of future feelings—both are bad news for believers in the rationality of choice. The cold-hand study showed that we cannot fully trust our preferences to reflect our interests, even if they are based on personal experience, and even if the memory of that experience was laid down within the last quarter of an hour!

No behavioral economist favors a state that will force its citizens to eat a balanced diet and to watch only television programs that are good for the soul. For behavioral economists, however, freedom has a cost, which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, and by a society that feels obligated to help them. The decision of whether or not to protect individuals against their mistakes therefore presents a dilemma for behavioral economists.

The lack of an appropriate code also explains why people usually do not detect the biases in their judgments of probability. A person could conceivably learn whether his judgments are externally calibrated by keeping a tally of the proportion of events that actually occur among those to which he assigns the same probability. However, it is not natural to group events by their judged probability. In the absence of such grouping it is impossible for an individual to discover, for example, that only 50% of the predictions to which he has assigned a probability of .9 or higher actually came true.

As one leading behavioral science textbook puts it, People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity. This is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored.

But goals are more toxic than Motivation 2.0 recognizes. In fact, the business school professors suggest they should come with their own warning label: Goals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased intrinsic motivation.

By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable. (If the task were desirable, the agent wouldn't need a prod.) But that initial signal, and the reward that goes with it, forces the principal onto a path that's difficult to leave. Offer too small a reward and the agent won't comply. But offer a reward that's enticing enough to get the agent to act the first time, and the principal is doomed to give it again in the second. There's no going back. Pay your son to take out the trash and you've pretty much guaranteed the kid will never do it again for free. What's more, once the initial money buzz tapers off, you'll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance.

Carrots, in this case, won't hurt and might help. And you'll increase your chances of success by supplementing the poster-packing rewards with three important practices: ¥ Offer a rationale for why the task is necessary. A job that's not inherently interesting can become more meaningful, and therefore more engaging, if it's part of a larger purpose. Explain why this poster is so important and why sending it out now is critical to your organization's mission. ¥ Acknowledge that the task is boring. This is an act of empathy, of course. And the acknowledgment will help people understand why this is the rare instance when if-then rewards are part of how your organization operates. ¥ Allow people to complete the task their own way . Think autonomy, not control. State the outcome you need. But instead of specifying precisely the way to reach it how each poster must be rolled and how each mailing label must be affixed give them freedom over how they do the job.

Your efforts will backfire unless the rewards you offer meet one essential requirement. And you'll be on firmer motivational footing if you follow two additional principles.

Já em Platão e Aristóteles a questão dos “melhores” aparece de modo claro. Na República a escola deveria selecionar os melhores para cuidar da cidade, e Aristóteles no seu livro Ética a Nicômaco fala da “grande alma” como o homem mais virtuoso e capaz, a partir do qual os outros vivem, como se a abundância de “força” desse homem alimentasse toda a comunidade. O que fica claro em ambos é a percepção de que alguns poucos capazes são sempre responsáveis pelo mundo. A função da educação é exatamente identificar nos alunos suas diferenças e colocá-las a serviço da sociedade. Os melhores lideram, os médios e medíocres seguem. Qualquer professor sabe disso numa sala de aula. Uma das maiores besteiras em educação é dizer que todos os alunos são iguais em capacidade de produzir e receber conhecimento.

O povo adere fácil e descaradamente (como aderiu nos séculos 19 e 20) a toda forma de totalitarismo. Se der comida, casa e hospital, o povo faz qualquer coisa que você pedir.

Outra característica problemática da democracia é sua vocação tagarela, como dizia o conde de Tocqueville. Nela, as pessoas são estimuladas a ter opinião sobre tudo, e a afirmação de que todos os homens são iguais (quando a igualdade deve ser apenas perante um tribunal) leva as pessoas mais idiotas a assumir que são capazes de opinar sobre tudo. E, como dizia nosso conde, Descartes (filósofo francês do século 17) nunca imaginou que alguém levasse tão a serio sua ideia de que o bom senso foi dado a todos os homens em “quantidades” iguais – o que evidentemente é uma mentira empírica. O resultado é que, se você põe em dúvida a capacidade igual entre os homens de ter opiniões, a sensibilidade democrática grita de agonia.

Mas talvez a pior coisa da democracia seja o fato de que ela deu aos idiotas a consciência de seu poder numérico, como dizia o sábio Nelson Rodrigues. Em suas colunas de jornais, o Nelson costumava dizer que os idiotas, maioria absoluta da humanidade, antes do advento da Revolução Francesa, viviam suas vidas comendo, reproduzindo e babando na gravata. Com a Revolução Francesa e a democracia (que a primeira não criou exatamente porque foi muito mais um regime de terror autoritário), os idiotas perceberam que são em maior número, e de lá para cá todo mundo passou a ter de agradá-los, a fim de ter a possibilidade de existir (principalmente intelectualmente).

Most leaders believed that the people in their organizations fundamentally disliked work and would avoid it if it they could. These faceless minions feared taking responsibility, craved security, and badly needed direction. As a result, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives. But McGregor said there was an alternative view of employees one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies. This perspective held that taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest, that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility.

O filme Avatar de alguns anos atrás é um exemplo ideal para entendermos o que é um romantismo para idiotas. No filme, a humanidade interesseira está destruindo uma civilização de índios azuis, os Naavis, que vivem num planeta cujo solo tem riquezas minerais. Ao final, alguns humanos unidos aos índios azuis salvam a “deusa natureza” do planeta, expulsam os malvados humanos (representantes da usura moderna) e voltam a viver em contato com a natureza. Cenas como as que mostram conversas com árvores, bestas-feras que se unem aos bons índios azuis contra os capitalistas malvados ou os índios azuis de mãos dadas cantando sons mágicos ao redor de árvores emocionaram milhares de idiotas pelo mundo. Todo mundo sabe que quase ninguém está disposto a viver como os índios, mas é comum gente boba achá-los “superavançados” com suas técnicas médicas do Neolítico.

Esse idiota usa a política como modo de esconder o mal em si mesmo. A defesa que o mentiroso PC faz da humanidade é na realidade uma defesa de si mesmo.

Outra marca da praga PC assolando os “teóricos de Deus” é a negação sistemática que fazem da ideia de homem pecador em favor da ideia de homem como bom em si, mas dominado pelo peso do capitalismo. A teologia da libertação retira do homem toda e qualquer capacidade de se ver como responsável pelo mal, a menos que ele seja rico, oprima sua mulher e seja homofóbico.

só fanático podia imaginar uma sociedade com “justiça social”, porque produzir riqueza tem a ver com originalidade, inteligência, capacidade de disciplina, e nada disso tem a ver com “igualdade”. A natureza não é igualitária em seus dons e suas dádivas, tampouco em suas misérias: poucos são sempre melhores do que a maioria. Isso não significa que devemos cultuar “injustiças sociais”, mas sim que o melhor remédio para “injustiça social” é riqueza e abundância, e não pregadores fanáticos pela justiça social

Ninguém é capaz de tanto amor; amamos, quando muito, nossos familiares (e olhe lá) e umas duas ou três pessoas a mais. Uma das formas mais comuns de agradar é ter amores politicamente corretos. Por exemplo, deveriam vender tribos de índio para defendermos e provarmos que temos “consciência ecossocial” – mentira, índios brasileiros só não destruíram a mata atlântica porque viviam no Neolítico e nem conheciam a roda.

As a result, their focus inevitably veers from the output of their work (solving a client's problem) to its input (piling up as many hours as possible).

By reducing ethics to a checklist, suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn't discriminating. Now the organization isn't focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off to show that what it did is OK (and so it won't get sued).

Deliberate practice is about changing your performance, setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time. ¥ Repeat, repeat, repeat . Repetition matters. Basketball greats don't shoot ten free throws at the end of team practice; they shoot five hundred. ¥ Seek constant, critical feedback . If you don't know how you're doing, you won't know what to improve. ¥ Focus ruthlessly on where you need help . While many of us work on what we're already good at, says Ericsson, those who get better work on their weaknesses. ¥ Prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting .

For instance it follows from it that if we wanted to increase the human life span, there are two general ways in which we could do it. Firstly, we could ban reproduction before a certain age, say forty. After some centuries of this the minimum age limit would be raised to fifty, and so on. It is conceivable that human longevity could be pushed up to several centuries by this means. I cannot imagine that anyone would seriously want to institute such a policy.   Secondly we could try to 'fool' genes into thinking that the body they are sitting in is younger than it really is.

What has all this to do with altruism and selfishness? I am trying to build up the idea that animal behaviour, altruistic or selfish, is under the control of genes in only an indirect, but still very powerful, sense. By dictating the way survival machines and their nervous systems are built, genes exert ultimate power over behaviour. But the moment-to-moment decisions about what to do next are taken by the nervous system. Genes are the primary policy-makers; brains are the executives. But as brains became more highly developed, they took over more and more of the actual policy decisions, using tricks like learning and simulation in doing so. The logical conclusion to this trend, not yet reached in any species, would be for the genes to give the survival machine a single overall policy instruction: do whatever you think best to keep us alive.

It will not really happen like that for some very good practical reasons. The names of some of these reasons are famine, plague, and war; or, if we are lucky, birth control. It is no use appealing to advances in agricultural science-'green revolutions' and the like. Increases in food production may temporarily alleviate the problem, but it is mathematically certain that they cannot be a long-term solution; indeed, like the medical advances that have precipitated the crisis, they may well make the problem worse, by speeding up the rate of the population expansion. It is a simple logical truth that, short of mass emigration into space, with rockets taking off at the rate of several million per second, uncontrolled birth-rates are bound to lead to horribly increased death-rates. It is hard to believe that this simple truth is not understood by those leaders who forbid their followers to use effective contraceptive methods. They express a preference for 'natural' methods of population limitation, and a natural method is exactly what they are going to get. It is called starvation.

What has happened in modern civilized man is that family sizes are no longer limited by the finite resources that the individual parents can provide. If a husband and wife have more children than they can feed, the state, which means the rest of the population, simply steps in and keeps the surplus children alive and healthy. There is, in fact, nothing to stop a couple with no material resources at all having and rearing precisely as many children as the woman can physically bear. But the welfare state is a very unnatural thing. In nature, parents who have more children than they can support do not have many grandchildren, and their genes are not passed on to future generations. There is no need for altruistic restraint in the birth-rate, because there is no welfare state in nature.

Any gene for overindulgence is promptly punished: the children containing that gene starve. Since we humans do not want to return to the old selfish ways where we let the children of too-large families starve to death, we have abolished the family as a unit of economic self-sufficiency, and substituted the state. But the privilege of guaranteed support for children should not be abused.

Contraception is sometimes attacked as 'unnatural'. So it is, very unnatural. The trouble is, so is the welfare state. I think that most of us believe the welfare state is highly desirable. But you cannot have an unnatural welfare state, unless you also have unnatural birth-control, otherwise the end result will be misery even greater than that which obtains in nature. The welfare state is perhaps the greatest altruistic system the animal kingdom has ever known. But any altruistic system is inherently unstable, because it is open to abuse by selfish individuals, ready to exploit it. Individual humans who have more children than they are capable of rearing are probably too ignorant in most cases to be accused of conscious malevolent exploitation. Powerful institutions and leaders who deliberately encourage them to do so seem to me less free from suspicion.

Socialismo significa planejamento centralizado. Um programa de vales-alimentação é bem-estar social; fazendas e supermercados administrados pelo governo constituem socialismo. Subsídios para moradia oferecidos pelo governo são parte do bem-estar social; projetos de habitação administrados pelo governo fazem parte do socialismo. Vouchers escolares são bem-estar social; um sistema escolar administrado pelo governo é socialismo.

“O nivelamento dos salários”, discursou Gorbachev diante do Comitê Central Soviético, em 1988, “possui um impacto destrutivo não apenas na economia, mas também na moralidade do povo e em suas maneiras de pensar e agir. Ele diminui o prestígio de atividades conscienciosas e criativas, enfraquece a disciplina, destrói o interesse no aperfeiçoamento de capacidades e é prejudicial ao espírito competitivo do trabalho. Devemos ser diretos ao dizer que o nivelamento de salários é um reflexo das visões pequeno-burguesas que nada têm em comum com o marxismo-leninismo ou com o socialismo científico.”

A relationship of mutual benefit between members of different species is called mutualism or symbiosis. Members of different species often have much to offer each other because they can bring different 'skills' to the partnership. This kind of fundamental asymmetry can lead to evolutionarily stable strategies of mutual cooperation.

Viruses consist of pure DNA (or a related self-replicating molecule) surrounded by a protein jacket. They are all parasitic. The suggestion is that they have evolved from 'rebel' genes who escaped, and now travel from body to body directly through the air, rather than via the more conventional vehicles-sperms and eggs. If this is true, we might just as well regard ourselves as colonies of viruses! Some of them cooperate symbiotically, and travel from body to body in sperms and eggs. These are the conventional 'genes'.

First of all, the fact that free trade is bad policy doesn’t mean that every kind of trade barrier is good policy.The habit of insisting that the only possible points along a spectrum are its two ends, common as it is, is an effective way to make really bad decisions; as in most things, there’s a middle ground that yields better results than either of the two extremes. Finding that middle ground isn’t necessarily easy, but the same thing’s true of most economic and political issues.

Let me end with a brief manifesto, a summary of the entire selfish gene/extended phenotype view of life. It is a view, I maintain, that applies to living things everywhere in the universe. The fundamental unit, the prime mover of all life, is the replicator. A replicator is anything in the universe of which copies are made. Replicators come into existence, in the first place, by chance, by the random jostling of smaller particles. Once a replicator has come into existence it is capable of generating an indefinitely large set of copies of itself. No copying process is perfect, however, and the population of replicators comes to include varieties that differ from one another. Some of these varieties turn out to have lost the power of self-replication, and their kind ceases to exist when they themselves cease to exist. Others can still replicate, but less effectively. Yet other varieties happen to find themselves in possession of new tricks: they turn out to be even better self-replicators than their predecessors and contemporaries. It is their descendants that come to dominate the population. As time goes by, the world becomes filled with the most powerful and ingenious replicators.   Gradually, more and more elaborate ways of being a good replicator are discovered. Replicators survive, not only by virtue of their own intrinsic properties, but by virtue of their consequences on the world. These consequences can be quite indirect. All that is necessary is that eventually the consequences, however tortuous and indirect, feed back and affect the success of the replicator at getting itself copied.   The success that a replicator has in the world will depend on what kind of a world it is-the pre-existing conditions. Among the most important of these conditions will be other replicators and their consequences. Like the English and German rowers, replicators that are mutually beneficial will come to predominate in each other's presence. At some point in the evolution of life on our earth, this ganging up of mutually compatible replicators began to be formalized in the creation of discrete vehicles-cells and, later, many-celled bodies. Vehicles that evolved a bottlenecked life cycle prospered, and became more discrete and vehicle-like.   This packaging of living material into discrete vehicles became such a salient and dominant feature that, when biologists arrived on the scene and started asking questions about life, their questions were mostly about vehicles-individual organisms. The individual organism came first in the biologist's consciousness, while the replicators-now known as genes-were seen as part of the machinery used by individual organisms. It requires a deliberate mental effort to turn biology the right way up again, and remind ourselves that the replicators come first, in importance as well as in history.   One way to remind ourselves is to reflect that, even today, not all the phenotypic effects of a gene are bound up in the individual body in which it sits. Certainly in principle, and also in fact, the gene reaches out through the individual body wall and manipulates objects in the world outside, some of them inanimate, some of them other living beings, some of them a long way away. With only a little imagination we can see the gene as sitting at the centre of a radiating web of extended phenotypic power. And an object in the world is the centre of a converging web of influences from many genes sitting in many organisms. The long reach of the gene knows no obvious boundaries. The whole world is criss-crossed with causal arrows joining genes to phenotypic effects, far and near.   It is an additional fact, too important in practice to be called incidental but not necessary enough in theory to be called inevitable, that these causal arrows have become bundled up. Replicators are no longer peppered freely through the sea; they are packaged in huge colonies-individual bodies. And phenotypic consequences, instead of being evenly distributed throughout the world, have in many cases congealed into those same bodies. But the individual body, so familiar to us on our planet, did not have to exist. The only kind of entity that has to exist in order for life to arise, anywhere in the universe, is the immortal replicator.

Joshua Bloch, in his book “Effective Java” says, “Favor composition over inheritance”. The problems with inheritance, in OOP, have become clearer over time. It is tragic that OOP has had to retreat from such a powerful idea, to the extent that composition is now the favored strategy: Composition over inheritance (or Composite Reuse Principle) in object-oriented programming is a technique by which classes may achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by containing other classes that implement the desired functionality instead of through inheritance. Some languages, notably Go, use type composition exclusively.

Most programming languages that I am aware of offer something like a struct or a record or an enum or a class — we can use these to enforce contracts. However, whatever data structure we use, do we need the complexity that is apparent in Chad Myers example? A simple record can give us contract-enforcement, but a class comes with a whole extra set of baggage that programmers would be wise to avoid. Please ask yourself what is really needed here. Do we need a Service object to fetch the User for us? Do we need Dependency Inversion to set our current object with a Service object so we can fetch a last name? Do we need OOP?

This makes them more flexible, and this facilitates code re-use.

I think this is a fundamental error since functions and data structures belong in totally different worlds. Why is this?

And there is an explicitly political idea that drove OOP to its peak in the 1990s: the idea of outsourcing. The idea of outsourcing software development rested on some assumptions about how software development should work, in particular the idea of the “genius” architect, backed by an army of morons who act as secretaries, taking dictation. OOP was the software equivalent of a trend that became common in manufacturing during the 1980s: design should stay in the USA while actual production should be sent to a 3rd World country. Working with UML diagrams, writing code could be reduced to mere grunt work, whereas the design of software could be handled by visionaries, possessed with epic imaginations, who could specify an OO hierarchy which could then be sent to India for a vast team to actually type out. And the teams in India (or Vietnam, or Romania, etc) were never trusted, they were assumed to be idiots, and so, for a moment, there was a strong market demand for a language that treated programmers like idiots, and so the stage was set for the emergence of Java.

Around the time that this effort finally petered out into absurdity, it was replaced by the core concept of the identity politics currently central to the American left: the conviction that the only divisions in American society that matter are those that have some basis in biology. Skin color, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability—these are the divisions that the American left likes to talk about these days, to the exclusion of all other social divisions, and especially to the exclusion of social class.Since the left has dominated public discourse in the United States for many decades now, those have become the divisions that the American right talks about, too.

Quem diz que amar é querer “o bem de quem ama” é porque nunca amou. Amar é querer o outro para si ou querer que o outro deixe de existir. Isso é “querer comer” o outro. Respeitar a mulher, nesse caso, é entregá-la na mão de outro homem. Porque ela quer é ser desrespeitada, esse é o sentido de dizer, como dizia o Nelson Rodrigues, que “toda mulher (as normais) gosta de apanhar”. A intimidade só existe quando há invasão do outro. Acho muito engraçado quando os arautos da chamada “ética da alteridade” (o respeito ao “outro” como pilar das relações humanas) querem contaminar a promiscuidade da vida sexual e amorosa com esse papo de respeito ao outro. Quando você respeita o outro, é porque já ficou indiferente a ele. Quando amamos e desejamos, violamos. E ela pede mais. O mundo melhor com o qual os idiotas sonham é um mundo sem amor e sem desejo.

A Revolução Cubana prometeu salvar Cuba pela destruição dos usurpadores imperialistas: transformou-a numa prisão de mendigos. Os positivistas brasileiros prometeram salvar o Brasil mediante a destruição da monarquia: acabaram com a única democracia que havia no continente e jogaram o país numa sucessão de golpes e ditaduras que só acabou em 1988 para dar lugar a uma ditadura modernizada com outro nome.

In Greek mythology, Cassandra is a very beautiful young maiden (‘like the golden Aphrodite’, Homer writes). Apollo, having fallen in love with her, offers her the gift of prophecy in exchange for her favours. Cassandra accepts his gift, only to refuse the god’s advances. Enraged, Apollo spits in her mouth, meaning that no one will ever understand or believe anything she says. She goes on to predict the rape of Helen by Paris, then the Trojan War, and she alerts her fellow Trojans to the ruse of the Greeks (the famous ‘Trojan Horse’) that allows them to capture the city. She winds up assassinated by Clytemnestra, but not before predicting her own murder and that of Agamemnon, who refuses to believe her. In short, Cassandra offered an example of worst-case predictions that always came true.

There are lots of numbers, because the article looks at all twenty-two EU member states, but the conclusion is the same in every case. Basically, they argue that belief in a transcendent being conveys a genetic advantage: that couples who follow one of the three religions of the Book and maintain patriarchal values have more children than atheists or agnostics. You see less education among women, less hedonism and individualism. And to a large degree, this belief in transcendence can be passed on genetically. Conversions, or cases where people grow up to reject family values, are statistically insignificant. In the vast majority of cases, people stick with whatever metaphysical system they grow up in. That’s why atheist humanism – the basis of any “pluralist society” – is doomed. Monotheism is on the rise, especially in the Muslim population – and that’s even before you factor in immigration. European nativists start by admitting that, sooner or later, we’ll see a civil war between the Muslims and everybody else.

So, over the next few weeks, the public learned that distributism was an English economic theory espoused at the turn of the last century by G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc. It was meant as a ‘third way’, neither capitalism nor communism – a sort of state capitalism, if you like. Its central idea was to do away with the separation between capital and labour. For distributists, the basic economic unit was the family business; when in certain sectors consolidation became necessary, the government had to ensure that the workers remained the owners and managers of their own enterprise.

Da Silva expressed his debt to an essay by the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, published a decade earlier, in which Bruckner had argued that marriage for love was a failure; he called for a return to marriage based on reason. Da Silva maintained that family ties, especially the tie between father and son, cannot be based on love, only on the transmission of practical knowledge and on inheritance. The transition to a salaried workforce had doomed the nuclear family and led to the complete atomisation of society, and that society could only be rebuilt if industry was based on a small-business model. In the past, arguments against romance may have enjoyed a succès de scandale, but before Da Silva the media never took them seriously, thanks to the universal consensus concerning individual liberty, the mystery of love, and so on. Da Silva was quick on his feet, an excellent debater, and basically indifferent to political or religious ideology.

Da Silva expressed his debt to an essay by the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, published a decade earlier, in which Bruckner had argued that marriage for love was a failure; he called for a return to marriage based on reason. Da Silva maintained that family ties, especially the tie between father and son, cannot be based on love, only on the transmission of practical knowledge and on inheritance. The transition to a salaried workforce had doomed the nuclear family and led to the complete atomisation of society, and that society could only be rebuilt if industry was based on a small-business model. In the past, arguments against romance may have enjoyed a succès de scandale, but before Da Silva the media never took them seriously, thanks to the universal consensus concerning individual liberty, the mystery of love, and so on. Da Silva was quick on his feet, an excellent debater, and basically indifferent to political or religious ideology. By sticking to his area of expertise – the evolution of family structures and their effects on the birth rate in Western societies – he kept from being swallowed up by his right-wing admirers, and instead became a leader in the debates that had begun to form (albeit very slowly, very gradually, without great animus, in a general atmosphere of tacit and lazy acceptance) around the domestic

Já acreditei em muitas mentiras, mas há uma à qual sempre fui imune: aquela que celebra a juventude como uma época de rebeldia, de independência, de amor à liberdade. Não dei crédito a essa patacoada nem mesmo quando, jovem eu próprio, ela me lisonjeava. Bem ao contrário, desde cedo me impressionaram muito fundo, na conduta de meus companheiros de geração, o espírito de rebanho, o temor do isolamento, a subserviência à voz corrente, a ânsia de sentir-se iguais e aceitos pela maioria cínica e autoritária, a disposição de tudo ceder, de tudo prostituir em troca de uma vaguinha de neófito no grupo dos sujeitos bacanas.

Na verdade, o cidadão moderno desejaria chutar todas as suas responsabilidades para o Estado: não quer proteger sua casa, mas ser protegido pela polícia; não quer educar-se para educar seus filhos, mas entregá-los a técnicos que os transformarão em robôs politicamente corretos; não quer decidir o que come, o que bebe, o que fuma ou deixa de fumar: quer que a burocracia médica lhe imponha a receita pronta; não quer crescer, ter consciência, ser livre e responsável: quer um pai estatal que o carregue no colo e contra o qual ainda possa fazer birra, batendo o pezinho na defesa dos seus “direitos”. O Estado sorri, porque sabe que, quantos mais direitos concede a esse cretino, mais leis são promulgadas, mais funcionários são contratados para aplicá-las, mais repartições burocráticas são criadas, mais impostos são cobrados para alimentá-las e, enfim, menor é a margem de liberdade de milhões de idiotas carregadinhos de direitos.

Em qualquer outra sociedade conhecida, um tipo assim estaria condenado ao isolamento. Seria um excêntrico. No Brasil, ao contrário, é o tipo dominante: o fingimento é geral, a fuga da realidade tornou-se instrumento de adaptação social. Mas adaptação, no caso, não significa eficiência, e sim acomodação e cumplicidade com o engano geral, produtor da geral ineficiência e do fracasso crônico, do qual em seguida se busca alívio em novas encenações, seja de revolta, seja de otimismo. Na medida em que se amolda à sociedade brasileira, a alma se afasta da realidade — e vice-versa. Ter a cabeça no mundo da lua, dar às coisas sistematicamente nomes falsos, viver num estado de permanente desconexão entre as percepções e o pensamento é o estado normal do brasileiro.

O sujeito não sabe, por exemplo, o que são transgênicos. Mas viu de relance, num jornal, que é coisa ruim. Melhor que coisa ruim: é coisa de má reputação. Falando contra ela, o cidadão sente-se igual a todo mundo, e rompe por instantes o isolamento que o humilha. Essa solidariedade no fingimento é a base do convívio brasileiro, o pilar de geleia sobre o qual se constroem uma cultura e milhões de vidas. Em outros lugares as pessoas em geral discutem coisas que existem, e só as discutem porque perceberam que existem. Aqui as discussões partem de simples nomes e sinais, imediatamente associados a valores, ao ruim e ao bom, a despeito da completa ausência das coisas consideradas.

A democracia não é como um pão, que cresce sem perder a homogeneidade: à medida que ela se expande, sua natureza vai mudando até converter-se no seu contrário. O exemplo mais característico — mas não o único, certamente — é o que se passa com a “democratização da cultura”. Num primeiro momento, democratizar a cultura é distribuir generosamente às massas os chamados “bens culturais”, antes reservados, segundo se diz, a uma elite. Num segundo momento, exige-se que as massas tenham também o direito de decidir o que é e o que não é um bem cultural. Aí a situação se inverte: oferecer às massas os bens de elite já não é praticar a democracia; é lançar à cara do povo um insulto paternalista. As camadas populares, afirma-se, têm direito à “sua própria cultura”, na qual a música rap pode ser, eventualmente, preferível a Bach. A intelectualidade entrega-se então a toda sorte de teorizações destinadas a provar que os bens superiores antes cobiçados pela massa não têm, no fim das contas, mais valor do que tudo o que a massa já possuía antes de conquistá-los.

E, quando enfim a antiga diferença entre cultura de elite e cultura de massas parece restabelecida sob o novo e reconfortante pretexto da relatividade, os intelectuais ficam mais revoltados ainda, ao descobrir que todos os bens, equalizados pelo universal relativismo, se transformaram em puras mercadorias sem valor próprio: Bach tornou-se fundo musical para anúncios de calcinhas e o rap, com a venda de discos, gerou uma nova elite de milionários, cínicos e prepotentes como a elite mais antiga jamais teria ousado ser.

vem talvez o perigo mais grave: um consenso em favor da democracia só é promissor em aparência, porque a democracia, por definição, consiste em prescindir de todo consenso. Democracia não é concórdia: é uma maneira inteligente de administrar a discórdia. E o clamor universal por “mais democracia”, na medida mesma em que se afirma como um consenso, já dá sinais de não poder suportar nenhuma voz discordante. Assim, há razões para temer que, se o século XX começou pedindo ditaduras e terminou por exigir a democracia, o novo século acabe por seguir o trajeto precisamente inverso. Afinal, dizia Bernanos, a democracia não é o oposto da ditadura: é a causa dela.

The Central Committee announced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause of them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no one knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is convenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean the progress of the Machine.

enthusiastic about the remilitarization of Europe. Outside the brief interval of enforced peace following the Second World War, Europe has been a boiling cauldron of warfare since its modern cultures began to emerge out of the chaos of the post-Roman dark ages. Most of the world’s most devastating wars have been European in origin, and of course it escapes no one’s attention in the rest of the world that it was from Europe that hordes of invaders and colonizers swept over the entire planet from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, as often as not leaving total devastation in their wake. In histories written a thousand years from now, Europeans will have the same sort of reputation that Huns and Mongols have today—and it’s only in the fond fantasies of those who think history has a direction that those days are definitely over.

O advento do hábito de cozinhar possibilitou aos humanos comer mais tipos de comida, dedicar menos tempo à alimentação e se virar com dentes menores e intestino mais curto. Alguns estudiosos acreditam que existe uma relação direta entre o advento do hábito de cozinhar, o encurtamento do trato intestinal e o crescimento do cérebro humano. Considerando que tanto um intestino longo quanto um cérebro grande consomem muita energia, é difícil ter os dois ao mesmo tempo. Ao encurtar o intestino e reduzir seu consumo de energia, o hábito de cozinhar inadvertidamente abriu caminho para o cérebro enorme dos neandertais e dos sapiens.

O estresse representado pela agricultura teve consequências importantes. Foi a base dos sistemas políticos e sociais de grande escala. Infelizmente, mesmo trabalhando duro, os camponeses quase nunca alcançaram a segurança econômica futura que tanto ansiavam. Em toda parte, brotaram governantes e elites, vivendo do excedente dos camponeses e deixando-os com o mínimo para a subsistência. Esses excedentes de alimento confiscados alimentaram a política, a guerra, a arte e a filosofia. Construíram palácios, fortes, monumentos e templos. Até o fim da era moderna, mais de 90% dos humanos eram camponeses que se levantavam todas as manhãs para trabalhar a terra com o suor da fronte. Os excedentes que produziam alimentavam a ínfima minoria das elites – reis, oficiais do governo, soldados, padres, artistas e pensadores –, que enchem os livros de história. A história é o que algumas poucas pessoas fizeram enquanto todas as outras estavam arando campos e carregando baldes de água.

É exatamente o que quero dizer com “ordem imaginada”. Acreditamos em uma ordem em particular não porque seja objetivamente verdadeira, mas porque acreditar nela nos permite cooperar de maneira eficaz e construir uma sociedade melhor. Ordens imaginadas não são conspirações malignas ou miragens inúteis. Ao contrário, são a única forma pela qual grandes números de seres humanos podem cooperar efetivamente.

O romantismo nos diz que para aproveitar ao máximo nosso potencial humano devemos ter tantas experiências diferentes quanto possível. Devemos nos abrir a um amplo leque de emoções; experimentar vários tipos de relacionamento; provar culinárias diferentes; aprender a apreciar diferentes estilos de música. Uma das melhores maneiras de fazer tudo isso é escapar da nossa rotina diária, deixar para trás nosso cenário familiar e viajar para terras distantes, onde podemos “vivenciar” a cultura, os aromas, os sabores e as normas de outros povos. Ouvimos repetidas vezes os mitos românticos sobre “como uma nova experiência abriu meus olhos e mudou minha vida”. O consumismo nos diz que para sermos felizes precisamos consumir tantos produtos e serviços quanto possível. Se sentimos que algo está faltando ou fora de lugar, provavelmente precisamos comprar um produto (um carro, roupas novas, comida orgânica) ou um serviço (limpeza doméstica, terapia de casais, aulas de yoga). Todo comercial de televisão é mais uma pequena lenda sobre como consumir algum produto ou serviço tornará a vida melhor.

Durante milhares de anos, filósofos, pensadores e profetas demonizaram o dinheiro e o consideraram a raiz de todos os males. Seja como for, o dinheiro é também o apogeu da tolerância humana. O dinheiro é mais tolerante que linguagem, leis estaduais, códigos culturais, crenças religiosas e hábitos sociais. O dinheiro é o único sistema de crenças criado pelos humanos que pode transpor praticamente qualquer abismo cultural e que não discrimina com base em religião, gênero, raça, idade ou orientação sexual. Graças ao dinheiro, até mesmo pessoas que não se conhecem e não confiam umas nas outras são capazes de cooperar de maneira efetiva.

Na verdade, o monoteísmo, tal como se desenvolveu ao longo da história, é um caleidoscópio de legados monoteístas, dualistas e politeístas que se misturam sob um único conceito divino. O cristão típico acredita no Deus monoteísta, mas também no Diabo dualista, em santos politeístas e em fantasmas animistas. Os estudiosos das religiões têm um nome para essa aceitação simultânea de ideias diferentes e até mesmo contraditórias e a combinação de rituais e práticas tirados de fontes diferentes: sincretismo.

Todas as tentativas modernas de estabilizar a ordem sociopolítica não tiveram outra escolha senão confiar em um de dois métodos não científicos: a. tomar uma teoria científica e, em oposição a práticas científicas comuns, declarar que é uma verdade final e absoluta. Esse foi o método usado por nazistas (que afirmaram que suas políticas raciais eram corolários de fatos biológicos) e comunistas (que afirmaram que Marx e Lenin haviam revelado verdades econômicas que jamais poderiam ser refutadas); b. deixar a ciência fora disso e viver de acordo com uma verdade absoluta não científica. Essa tem sido a estratégia do humanismo liberal, que se baseia em uma crença dogmática nos direitos e no valor singular dos seres humanos – uma doutrina que tem embaraçosamente pouco em comum com o estudo científico do Homo sapiens. Mas isso não deveria nos surpreender. Até mesmo a própria ciência tem de se apoiar em crenças ideológicas e religiosas para justificar e financiar suas pesquisas. A cultura atual, entretanto, tem mostrado muito mais disposição para abraçar a ignorância do que qualquer cultura anterior. Uma das coisas que tornaram possível que as ordens sociais modernas se mantenham coesas é a disseminação de uma crença quase religiosa na tecnologia e nos métodos da pesquisa científica, que, em certa medida, substituíram a crença em verdades absolutas.

Consequentemente, a história humana foi dominada por dois ciclos principais: os ciclos de crescimento das plantas e os ciclos alternados de energia solar (dia e noite, verão e inverno). Quando a luz do Sol era escassa e quando os campos de trigo continuavam verdes, os humanos tinham pouca energia. Os celeiros ficavam vazios, os cobradores de impostos ficavam ociosos, os soldados tinham dificuldade para se locomover e lutar, e os reis tendiam a manter a paz. Quando o Sol brilhava e o trigo amadurecia, os camponeses colhiam as sementes e enchiam os celeiros. Os cobradores de impostos corriam para garantir sua parte. Os soldados retesavam os músculos e afiavam as espadas. Os reis convocavam conselhos e planejavam as campanhas seguintes. Todos eram abastecidos pela energia solar – capturada e armazenada na forma de trigo, arroz e batata.

A Revolução Industrial deu ao mercado novos poderes gigantescos, proveu o Estado de novos meios de comunicação e transporte e colocou à disposição do governo um exército de escriturários, professores, policiais e assistentes sociais. De início o mercado e o Estado descobriram que seu caminho estava bloqueado por famílias e comunidades tradicionais que tinham pouca afeição por intervenção externa.

Família e comunidade parecem ter mais impacto na nossa felicidade do que dinheiro e saúde. Pessoas com famílias coesas que vivem em comunidades unidas que lhes dão apoio são significativamente mais felizes do que pessoas cujas famílias são disfuncionais e que nunca encontraram (ou nunca buscaram) uma comunidade da qual fazer parte. O casamento é particularmente importante. Repetidos estudos descobriram que há uma relação muito direta entre bons casamentos e nível elevado de bem-estar subjetivo e entre maus casamentos e sofrimento. Isso é verdade independentemente de condições econômicas ou mesmo físicas. Um inválido sem recursos cercado por uma esposa amorosa, uma família dedicada e uma comunidade afetuosa pode se sentir melhor do que um bilionário alienado, contanto que a pobreza do inválido não seja extrema e que sua doença não seja degenerativa nem dolorosa.

O que há de tão importante em obter tais prêmios efêmeros? Por que se esforçar tanto para conquistar algo que desaparece quase no mesmo instante em que surge? De acordo com o budismo, a raiz do sofrimento não é a sensação de dor nem de tristeza e nem mesmo de falta de sentido. Em vez disso, a raiz do sofrimento é essa incessante e inútil busca de sensações efêmeras, que nos leva a estar em um constante estado de tensão, inquietude e insatisfação. Devido a essa busca, a mente nunca está satisfeita. Mesmo quando sentimos prazer, ela não está contente, porque teme que essa sensação logo desapareça e deseja ardentemente que permaneça e se intensifique.

As pessoas só se libertam do sofrimento não quando experimentam essa ou aquela sensação de prazer, e sim quando entendem a natureza transitória de todos os seus sentimentos e param de persegui-los. Esse é o objetivo das práticas de meditação budistas. Na meditação, espera-se que você observe sua mente e seu corpo com atenção, que testemunhe o incessante ir e vir de todos os seus sentimentos e perceba como é inútil persegui-los. Quando a busca cessa, a mente fica tranquila, clara e satisfeita. Sentimentos de todo tipo continuam indo e vindo – alegria, raiva, tédio, desejo –, mas quando você para de ansiar por sentimentos específicos, pode simplesmente aceitá-los tal como são. Você vive o momento presente em vez de fantasiar sobre o que poderia ter sido.

característica essencial da nossa época é justamente a transformação cultural planejada, e quem não seja capaz de percebê-la estará privado da possibilidade de lhe oferecer uma reação consciente: por mais dinheiro que tenha no bolso ou por mais alto cargo que ocupe na hierarquia política, jurídica ou militar, estará reduzido à condição de “massa de manobra” no sentido mais desprezível do termo. O sonho dos iluministas do século XVIII — uma sociedade inteira à mercê dos planos da elite “esclarecida” — tornou-se realizável dois séculos depois graças a três fatores: a expansão do ensino universitário, criando uma massa de intelectuais sem funções definidas na sociedade e prontos para ser arregimentados em tarefas militantes; o progresso dos meios de comunicação, que permite atingir populações inteiras a partir de uns poucos centros emissores; e a enorme concentração de riquezas nas mãos de alguns grupos oligárquicos imbuídos de ambições messiânicas.

Mas isso não justifica o fato de que o universo de criadores de conteúdo para audiovisual seja alienado com relação ao mundo em que vive, causando, muitas vezes, maior reação negativa do que positiva. Obrigar a classe média a ver duas senhoras se beijando, e achar que isso “educa” a afetividade das pessoas, não só é errado como é autoritário. Gente que trabalha e se ferra todo dia não precisa ser objeto de pregação quando quer relaxar na frente da TV. Só gente chata não entende que militância na hora do lazer é falta de educação. O politicamente correto, mais uma vez, se mostra não apenas autoritário, mas também estúpido na sua insistência em dizer como as pessoas devem agir quando chegam em casa à noite depois de um dia infernal de trabalho. Os produtores de conteúdo, aliás, como quase todo mundo que trabalha com cultura, são vítimas da patrulha ideológica correta. Poucos têm coragem de enfrentar a censura correta.

In today’s Western society the inequality has been revealed [in] freedom for good deeds and freedom for evil deeds. A statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has to move cautiously and even timidly. There are thousands of hasty and irresponsible critics around him; parliament and the press keep rebuffing him. As he moves ahead, he has to prove that each single step of his is well-founded and absolutely flawless. Actually, an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself. From the very beginning, dozens of traps will be set out for him. Thus, mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of restrictions imposed by democracy.

Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic disease of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press. Such as it is, however, the press has become the greatest power within the Western countries, more powerful than the legislative power, the executive, and the judiciary. And one would then like to ask: By what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible? In the communist East a journalist is frankly appointed as a state official. But who has granted Western journalists their power, for how long a time, and with what prerogatives?

But members of the U.S. anti-war movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there.

The turn introduced by the Renaissance evidently was inevitable historically. The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion, becoming an intolerable despotic repression of man’s physical nature in favor of the spiritual one. Then, however, we turned our backs upon the Spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal. This new way of thinking, which had imposed on us its guidance, did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth. It based modern Western civilization on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs. Everything beyond physical well-being and accumulation of material goods, all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature, were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems, as if human life did not have any superior sense. That provided access for evil, of which in our days there is a free and constant flow. Merely freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones.

The West ended up by truly enforcing human rights, sometimes even excessively, but man’s sense of responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer. In the past decades, the legalistically selfish aspect of Western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse. All the glorified technological achievements of Progress, including the conquest of outer space, do not redeem the 20th century’s moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the 19th Century.

To such consciousness, man is the touchstone in judging everything on earth — imperfect man, who is never free of pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other defects. We are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience, but we have lost the concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life. In the East, it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party. In the West, commercial interests suffocate it. This is the real crisis.

Hormesis lost some scientific respect, interest, and practice after the 1930s because some people mistakenly associated it with homeopathy. The association was unfair, as the mechanisms are extremely different. Homeopathy is based on other principles, such as the one that minute, highly diluted parts of the agents of a disease (so small they can hardly be perceptible, hence cannot cause hormesis) can help cure us of the disease itself. Homeopathy has shown little empirical backing and because of its testing methodologies belongs today to alternative medicine, while hormesis, as a phenomenon, has ample scientific evidence to back it up. But the larger point is that we can now see that depriving systems of stressors, vital stressors, is not necessarily a good thing, and can be downright harmful.

Likewise, we humans may have to be self-centered at the expense of other species, at the risk of ecological fragility, if it insures our survival. Our interests—as a human race—prevail over those of nature; and we can tolerate some inefficiency, some fragility, in order to protect individuals, although sacrificing nature too much may eventually hurt ourselves. We saw the trade-off between the interests of the collective and those of the individual. An economy cannot survive without breaking individual eggs; protection is harmful, and constraining the forces of evolution to benefit individuals does not seem required. But we can shield individuals from starvation, provide some social protection. And give them respect.

Do crazy things (break furniture once in a while), like the Greeks during the later stages of a drinking symposium, and stay “rational” in larger decisions. Trashy gossip magazines and classics or sophisticated works; never middlebrow stuff. Talk to either undergraduate students, cab drivers, and gardeners or the highest caliber scholars; never to middling-but-career-conscious academics. If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally.

The essayist Michel de Montaigne sees the Thales episode as a story of immunity to sour grapes: you need to know whether you do not like the pursuit of money and wealth because you genuinely do not like it, or because you are rationalizing your inability to be successful at it with the argument that wealth is not a good thing because it is bad for one’s digestive system or disturbing for one’s sleep or other such arguments.

If you “have optionality,” you don’t have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don’t have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur. (The key is that your assessment doesn’t need to be made beforehand, only after the outcome.)

EPIPHENOMENA The Soviet-Harvard illusion (lecturing birds on flying and believing that the lecture is the cause of these wonderful skills) belongs to a class of causal illusions called epiphenomena. What are these illusions? When you spend time on the bridge of a ship or in the coxswain’s station with a large compass in front, you can easily develop the impression that the compass is directing the ship rather than merely reflecting its direction.

People who build their strength using these modern expensive gym machines can lift extremely large weights, show great numbers and develop impressive-looking muscles, but fail to lift a stone; they get completely hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn’t exist outside of ludic—extremely organized—constructs. In fact their strength, as with overspecialized athletes, is the result of a deformity.

The “apophatic” focuses on what cannot be said directly in words, from the Greek apophasis (saying no, or mentioning without mentioning). The method began as an avoidance of direct description, leading to a focus on negative description, what is called in Latin via negativa, the negative way, after theological traditions, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

A simple solution, but quite drastic: anyone who goes into public service should not be allowed to subsequently earn more from any commercial activity than the income of the highest paid civil servant. It is like a voluntary cap (it would prevent people from using public office as a credential-building temporary accommodation, then going to Wall Street to earn several million dollars). This would get priestly people into office.

The fooled-by-data effect is accelerating. There is a nasty phenomenon called “Big Data” in which researchers have brought cherry-picking to an industrial level. Modernity provides too many variables (but too little data per variable), and the spurious relationships grow much, much faster than real information, as noise is convex and information is concave.

This is a very strong via negativa statement: it means we can’t use covariance matrices—they are unreliable and uninformative. Actually just accepting fat tails would have led us to such result—no need for empiricism; I processed the data nevertheless. Now any honest scientific profession would say: “what do we do with such evidence?”—the economics and finance establishment just ignored it. A bunch of charlatans, by any scientific norm and ethical metric. Many “Nobels” (Engle, Merton, Scholes, Markowitz, Miller, Samuelson, Sharpe, and a few more) have their results grounded in such central assumptions, and all their works would evaporate otherwise.

The present civilisation cannot endure. Its foundations are contrary to reality. It is clashing not so much against ideological contradictions – which can always be overcome – but, for the first time, against a physical wall. The old faith in miracles of egalitarianism and the philosophy of progress – which suggests one can have his cake and eat it too – is now coming to an end. This fairytale ideology has led to a world of illusions that is less and less credible.

But the ethno-pluralist dogma – which stands in contradiction to anti-egalitarianism – prevented this.

The challenges that shake the world and threaten the downfall of egalitarian modernity are already of an archaic sort: the religious challenge of Islam; the geopolitical and thalassocratic[34] battles over scarce agricultural, fishing and energy resources; the conflict between North and South, and colonising immigration into the northern hemisphere; the pollution of the planet and the physical clash between the ideology of development and reality. All these challenges lead us back to age-old problems. The almost theological political discussions of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries, which were like debates concerning the gender of angels, are being cast into oblivion. This return to ‘archaic’ (and hence fundamental) questions baffles ‘modern’ intellectuals, who expound on homosexuals’ right to get married and other such inanities.

Forever suited to human nature, these values reject the erroneous idea of individual emancipation promoted by the philosophy of the Enlightenment, which leads to the isolation of man and social barbarism. These archaic values are just in the ancient Greek sense of the term, for they see man for what he is, a zoon politikòn (‘social and organic animal within a communitarian city’) rather than for what he is not – an asexual and isolated atom possessing universal and enduring pseudo-rights.

One of the few obvious things about our age, which both traditionalists and modernists agree about, is that Western civilisation has de-spiritualised life, destroying all transcendental values. The failed attempts at established secular religions, the empty disenchantment created by a civilisation that bases its ultimate legitimacy on the value of exchange and the cult of money, and the self-destruction of Christianity have engendered a situation that cannot endure. Malraux[55] was right: the Twenty-first century will witness a return to spirituality and religion.

On a global scale, sport has not only become an industry (the turnover of FIFA[66] is greater than the state budget of France) – a cause of widespread corruption, doping, and astronomical earnings – but it is also an essential part of showbiz. For this reason, as a new opium for the masses in a West lacking any religion, it fully contributes to the overall lobotomisation of society. The spectacle of sport infantilises consciences, conceals social problems and the failings of politics. France’s success in the last Football World Cup is a sensational example of this. It has been presented as the ‘victory of multiracialism and successful integration’ and the ‘symbol of a France that is finally winning’, but this is only mockery, falsehood, and dissimulation.

The rejection of school and university selectivity, which aimed at replacing equality of results with equal opportunities, by a heterotelic effect, brought less social justice. The results, thirty years after the introduction of this perverse principle (‘orientation replacing selection’), are: a depreciation of diplomas, which contributes to unemployment; a flight of brains towards Anglo-Saxon universities; a general worsening of teaching and a growth in illiteracy; the end of school as a place of competition and education, and its partial transformation into an unbearable jungle; the creation of a two-tier school system: one private, qualified and selective for the rich, and one public and under-qualified for the poor. Paradoxically, the egalitarian opposition to selectivity launched in May ’68 is one of the causes of the present ‘exclusion’.

Only when on the brink of disaster – when economic hedonism has come to an end – will the European peoples find the strength to react against what awaits them. No effective solutions can be expected prior to the unleashing of the catastrophe that will most likely take place. People’s power to resist has been sapped by consumerism, comfort, and the countless ‘commodities’ of the society of the spectacle. People are weakened by the slack life they lead, by their boundless individualism, by the dreams promoted via television and advertising, and by their virtual experiences. This is what the anthropologist Arnold Gehlen has termed ‘second-hand experiences’ – socio-economic opium. Societies based on conspicuous consumption – as Thorstein Veblen[128] noted in the early Twentieth century – have undermined their own economic and social foundations. They have destroyed their own dreams of freedom, emancipation, equality, justice and prosperity by pushing them to their very limit, to the absurd, so that by a boomerang effect these societies are no longer capable of resisting financial crises, criminal organisations, and the social upheavals they have caused. This is an example of the dialectical reversal that Marx and Jules Monnerot have described.

Today, instead of striving to rebuild things, it might be better to leave the educational system to collapse completely, given its inability to accomplish its task and the state’s utter lack of interest in the matter. The new state that will emerge in the post-catastrophic world may take things in hand again.

The only solution for the Left, then, is hypocritical progressivism.

The plan here is a very simple one: to increase the population of immigrant voters; and then, to make it easier for them to vote by automatically enrolling them on electoral lists (this used to be a voluntary, ‘civil’ process). This is a short-term plan, but one that effectively serves the career interests of politicians of the Left and far Left, i.e., to ensure a lasting majority of votes to preserve their own power.

Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black "underclass" they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African-American culture. But in what does this preservation of African-American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers "responsible," they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial-technological system. The system couldn't care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a "responsible" parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.

The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual's loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a small-scale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system.

In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. A young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food. (In young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won't discuss that here.) This phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (In contrast, some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of "fulfillment." We suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process---with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. Many modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. We argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical use, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. It is not the primitive man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life.

The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system. This has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system. It is not the fault of capitalism and it is not the fault of socialism. It is the fault of technology, because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity. Of course the system does satisfy many human needs, but generally speaking it does this only to the extent that it is to the advantage of the system to do it. It is the needs of the system that are paramount, not those of the human being.

Various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion. Leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural being. But for the leftist, leftism plays a psychological role much like that which religion plays for some people. The leftist NEEDS to believe in leftism; it plays a vital role in his psychological economy. His beliefs are not easily modified by logic or facts. He has a deep conviction that leftism is morally Right with a capital R, and that he has not only a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on everyone. (However, many of the people we are referring to as "leftists" do not think of themselves as leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs as leftism. We use the term "leftism" because we don't know of any better word to designate the spectrum of related creeds that includes the feminist, gay rights, political correctness, etc., movements, and because these movements have a strong affinity with the old left.

The main thrust of propaganda in our society is in favor of the stated values. The main reason why these values have become, so to speak, the official values of our society is that they are useful to the industrial system. Violence is discouraged because it disrupts the functioning of the system. Racism is discouraged because ethnic conflicts also disrupt the system, and discrimination wastes the talents of minority-group members who could be useful to the system. Poverty must be "cured" because the underclass causes problems for the system and contact with the underclass lowers the morale of the other classes. Women are encouraged to have careers because their talents are useful to the system and, more importantly, because by having regular jobs women become integrated into the system and tied directly to it rather than to their families. This helps to weaken family solidarity. (The leaders of the system say they want to strengthen the family, but what they really mean is that they want the family to serve as an effective tool for socializing children in accord with the needs of the system.

We emphasize the problem of purposelessness because the liberals and leftists would wish to solve our social problems by having society guarantee everyone's security; but if that could be done it would only bring back the problem of purposelessness. The real issue is not whether society provides well or poorly for people's security; the trouble is that people are dependent on the system for their security rather than having it in their own hands. This, by the way, is part of the reason why some people get worked up about the right to bear arms; possession of a gun puts that aspect of their security in their own hands.

As pessoas no livro de Huxley eram umas idiotas fabricadas geneticamente. As pessoas do mundo real são umas idiotas obcecadas pela saúde e pela felicidade. A vida precisa ser um pouco desperdiçada e suja, senão se torna uma natureza-morta perfeita. É isso que Huxley apreendeu ainda nos anos 1930: segundo ele, no futuro pediríamos para ser escravos de procedimentos de saúde e felicidade. E acertou em cheio, não?

O interessante dessa ladainha é que, ao mesmo tempo, quem lamenta a morte dos valores é o mesmo que acha que tudo deve ser novo e dissociado do passado. Valores só existem quando existem condutas bem marcadas por expectativas sociais que herdamos para além de nossa vontade.

Para os gregos, as paixões e os desejos eram tormentos. A ética buscava o repouso, a tranquilidade da alma, a ausência de paixões e desejos. Isso eles chamavam de hedone. O pathos (paixão, doença, sofrimento) era aquilo a ser evitado. Dito de forma direta: prazer era não ter desejos nem paixões.

A ideia é que desejar implica escravidão.

Nossa evolução se deu num ambiente de deveres e não de direitos. O próprio sucesso do capitalismo aconteceu graças à moral dos deveres e não dos direitos. A felicidade do indivíduo nunca foi critério para a sobrevivência da espécie. O bando original, cuja última representação é a família, também em processo de dissolução, deixou de ser a referência. A nova referência é o sujeito e seus gostos. Nada garante que nossa espécie esteja adaptada à obsessão pela felicidade individual.

Quanto ao cristianismo das sociedades industriais, principalmente o dos intelectuais, há muito que perdeu os valores cósmicos que possuía ainda na Idade Média. Isto não implica necessariamente que o cristianismo urbano seja “degradado” ou “inferior”, mas apenas que a sensibilidade religiosa das populações urbanas encontra- se gravemente empobrecida. A liturgia cósmica, o mistério da participação da Natureza no drama cristológico tornaram-se inacessíveis aos cristãos que vivem numa cidade moderna.

Conhecer as situações assumidas pelo homem religioso, compreender seu universo espiritual é, em suma, fazer avançar o conhecimento geral do homem. É verdade que a maior parte das situações assumidas pelo homem religioso das sociedades primitivas e das civilizações arcaicas há muito tempo foram ultrapassadas pela História. Mas não desapareceram sem deixar vestígios: contribuíram para que nos tornássemos aquilo que somos hoje; fazem parte, portanto, da nossa própria história.

Isto significa que o homem a religioso se constitui por oposição a seu predecessor, esforçando se por se “esvaziar” de toda religiosidade e de todo significado trans humano. Ele reconhece a si próprio na medida em que se “liberta” e se “purifica” das “superstições” de seus antepassados. Em outras palavras, o homem profano, queira ou não, conserva ainda os vestígios do comportamento do homem religioso, mas esvaziado dos significados religiosos. Faça o que fizer, é um herdeiro. Não pode abolir definitivamente seu passado, porque ele próprio é produto desse passado: É constituído por uma série de negações e recusas, mas continua ainda a ser assediado pelas realidades que recusou e negou. Para obter um mundo próprio, dessacralizou o mundo em que viviam seus antepassados; mas, para chegar aí, foi obrigado a adotar um comportamento oposto àquele que o precedia – e ele sente que este comportamento está sempre prestes a reatualizar-se, de uma forma ou outra, no mais profundo de seu ser.

É por isso que, num horizonte religioso, a existência é fundada pela iniciação; quase se poderia dizer que, na medida em que se realiza, a própria existência humana é uma iniciação. Em suma, a maioria dos homens “sem religião” partilha ainda das pseudo religiões e mitologias degradadas. Isso, porém, não nos surpreende, pois, como vimos, o homem profano descende do homo religiosus e não pode anular sua própria história, quer dizer, os comportamentos de seus antepassados religiosos, que o constituíram tal como ele é hoje.

Modernity designates the political and philosophical movement of the last three centuries of Western history. It is characterised primarily by five converging processes: individualisation, through the destruction of old forms of communal life; massification, through the adoption of standardised behaviour and lifestyles; desacralisation, through the displacement of the great religious narratives by a scientific interpretation of the world; rationalisation, through the domination of instrumental reason, the free market, and technical efficiency; and universalisation, through a planetary extension of a model of society postulated implicitly as the only rational possibility and thus as superior.

This general crisis is a sign that modernity is reaching its end, precisely when the universalist utopia that established it is poised to become a reality under the form of liberal globalisation. The end of the Twentieth century marks both the end of modern times and the beginning of a postmodernity characterised by a series of new themes: preoccupation with ecology, concern for the quality of life, the role of ‘tribes’ and of ‘networks’, revival of communities, the politics of group identities, multiplication of intra- and supra-state conflicts, the return of social violence, the decline of established religions, growing opposition to social elitism, etc.

Yet, despite their mutual hostility, liberalism and Marxism basically belong to the same universe and are both the heirs of Enlightenment thought: they share the same individualism, even the same universal egalitarianism, the same rationalism, the same primacy of economics, the same stress on the emancipatory value of labour, the same faith in progress, the same idea of an end of history. In almost all respects, liberalism has only realised more effectively certain objectives it shares with Marxism: the eradication of collective identities and traditional cultures, the disenchantment of the world, and the universalisation of the system of production.

This last approach supports the ideology of human rights, which is at once a minimal moral code and a strategic weapon of Western ethnocentrism. This ideology is a contradiction in terms. All men have rights, but they would not know how to be entitled to them as isolated beings; a right expresses a relation of equity, which implies the social. Thus, no right is conceivable outside a specific context in which to define it, outside a society to recognise it and to define the duties which represent the counterpart to it, and the means of constraint sufficient to apply it. As for fundamental liberties, they are not decreed, but they must be conquered and guaranteed.

Undertaken under the aegis of missionaries, armies, and merchants, the Westernisation of the planet has represented an imperialist movement fed by the desire to erase all otherness by imposing on the world a supposedly superior model invariably presented as ‘progress’.

In regard to universalist utopias and the withering of traditional identities, the French New Right affirms the primacy of differences, which are neither transitory features leading to some higher form of unity, nor incidental aspects of private life. Rather, these differences are the very substance of social life. They can be native (ethnic, linguistic), but also political. Citizenship implies belonging, allegiance and participation in public life at different levels. Thus, one can be, at one and the same time, a citizen of one’s neighbourhood, city, region, nation, and of Europe, according to the nature of power devolved to each of these levels of sovereignty. By contrast, one cannot be a citizen of the world, for the ‘world’ is not a political category. Wanting to be a citizen of the world is to link citizenship to an abstraction drawn from the vocabulary of the Liberal New Class.

The responsibility for current immigration lies primarily, not with the immigrants, but with the industrialised nations which have reduced man to the level of merchandise that can be relocated anywhere. Immigration is not desirable for the immigrants, who are forced to abandon their native country for another where they are received as back-ups for economic needs. Nor is immigration beneficial for the host population receiving the immigrants, who are confronted, against their will, with sometimes brutal modifications in their human and urban environments.

It also engenders abstract individualism, utilitarian beliefs, a superficial humanitarianism, indifference to history, an obvious lack of culture, isolation from the real world, the sacrifice of the real to the virtual, an inclination to corruption, nepotism and to buying votes.

This leads to sucker problems: when the map does not correspond to the territory, there is a certain category of fool—the overeducated, the academic, the journalist, the newspaper reader, the mechanistic “scientist,” the pseudo-empiricist, those endowed with what I call “epistemic arrogance,” this wonderful ability to discount what they did not see, the unobserved—who enter a state of denial, imagining the territory as fitting his map. More generally, the fool here is someone who does the wrong reduction for the sake of reduction, or removes something essential, cutting off the legs, or, better, part of the head of a visitor while insisting that he preserved his persona with 95 percent accuracy. Look around at the Procrustean beds we’ve created, some beneficial, some more questionable: regulations, top-down governments, academia, gyms, commutes, high-rise office buildings, involuntary human relationships, employment, etc.

instalment of sacred kings; his wings were symbolical of a celestial nature, rather than speed. Jane Harrison has pointed out (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, chapter v) that Medusa was once the goddess herself, hiding behind a prophylactic Gorgon mask: a hideous face intended to warn the profane against trespassing on her Mysteries. Perseus beheads Medusa: that is, the Hellenes overran the goddess’s chief shrines, stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks, and took possession of the sacred horses – an early representation of the goddess with a Gorgon’s head and a mare’s body has been found in Boeotia. Bellerophon, Perseus’s double, kills the Lycian Chimaera: that is, the Hellenes annulled the ancient Medusan calendar, and replaced it with another. Again, Apollo’s destruction of the Python at Delphi seems to record the Achaeans’ capture of the Cretan Earth-goddess’s shrine; so does his attempted rape of Daphne, whom Hera thereupon metamorphosed into a laurel. This myth has been quoted by Freudian psychologists as symbolizing a girl’s instinctive horror of the sexual act; yet Daphne was anything but a frightened virgin. Her name

How? Probability is not a mere computation of odds on the dice or more complicated variants; it is the acceptance of the lack of certainty in our knowledge and the development of methods for dealing with our ignorance. Outside of textbooks and casinos, probability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or a brain teaser. Mother nature does not tell you how many holes there are on the roulette table, nor does she deliver problems in a textbook way (in the real world one has to guess the problem more than the solution). In this book, considering that alternative outcomes could have taken place, that the world could have been different, is the core of probabilistic thinking.

I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision).

epic poet did not judge his heroes by the result: Heroes won and lost battles in a manner that was totally independent of their own valor; their fate depended upon totally external forces, generally the explicit agency of the scheming gods (not devoid of nepotism). Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost. Patrocles does not strike us as a hero because of his accomplishments (he was rapidly killed) but because he preferred to die than see Achilles sulking into inaction. Clearly, the epic poets understood invisible histories. Also later thinkers and poets had more elaborate methods for dealing with randomness, as we will see with stoicism.

Curiously, life insurers in renaissance Italy reached the same conclusion, by charging the same insurance for a man in his twenties as they did for a man in his fifties, a sign that they had the same life expectancy; once a man crossed the forty-year mark, he had shown that very few ailments could harm him.

Accordingly, it is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made when it happens that should be the consideration. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it is the magnitude of the outcome that counts. It is a pure accounting fact that, aside from the commentators, very few people take home a check linked to how often they are right or wrong. What they get is a profit or loss.

It is worth stopping, at this juncture, and discussing the distinction between normative and positive sciences. A normative science (clearly a self-contradictory concept) offers prescriptive teachings; it studies how things should be. Some economists, for example those of the efficient-market religion, believe that our studies should be based on the hypothesis that humans are rational and act rationally because it is the best thing for them to do (it is mathematically “optimal”). The opposite is a positive science, which is based on how people actually are observed to behave. In spite of economists’ envy of physicists, physics is an inherently positive science while economics, particularly microeconomics and financial economics, is predominantly a normative one. Normative economics is like religion without the aesthetics.

Ask your local mathematician to define probability; he would most probably show you how to compute it. As we saw in Chapter 3 on probabilistic introspection, probability is not about the odds, but about the belief in the existence of an alternative outcome, cause, or motive. Recall that mathematics is a tool to meditate, not compute.

Deixei o encontro percebendo que somente os militares lidam com a aleatoriedade com honestidade genuína e intelectualmente introspectiva — diferentemente de acadêmicos e executivos corporativos que usam o dinheiro de outras pessoas. Isso não é mostrado em filmes de guerra, onde são comumente retratados como autocratas famintos por guerras. As pessoas à minha frente não eram aquelas que iniciam guerras. Na verdade, para muitos, uma política de defesa bem-sucedida é aquela que consegue eliminar perigos em potencial sem guerra, como a estratégia de levar os russos à falência por meio do aumento constante das despesas com defesa.

Agora leia qualquer um dos pensadores clássicos que tiveram algo prático a dizer sobre o acaso, como Cícero, e descobrirá algo diferente: uma noção de probabilidade que permanece sempre nebulosa, como deve ser, já que tal nebulosidade é a própria natureza da incerteza. A probabilidade é uma arte liberal; ela é filha do ceticismo e não uma ferramenta para pessoas com calculadoras presas aos cintos satisfazerem desejos de produzir cálculos e certezas extravagantes. Antes de o pensamento ocidental afogar-se na mentalidade “científica”, o que é chamado com arrogância de Iluminismo, as pessoas colocavam os próprios cérebros para pensar — e não para computar. Em um belo tratado que desapareceu de nossa consciência, Dissertação sobre a busca da verdade, publicado em 1673, o polemista Simon Foucher expôs nossa predileção mental por certezas.

o problema do conhecimento organizado é que há uma divergência de interesses ocasional entre associações acadêmicas e o próprio conhecimento. Assim, não consigo entender de forma alguma por que os libertários de hoje não atacam a estabilidade de emprego de professores de faculdade (exceto, talvez, porque muitos libertários são acadêmicos). Vimos que companhias podem quebrar, enquanto governos permanecem. Mas, enquanto governos permanecem, funcionários públicos podem ser rebaixados e congressistas e senadores podem ter os mandatos cassados finalmente por votação. No meio acadêmico, um professor com estabilidade é permanente — o negócio do conhecimento possui “donos” permanentes.

Eu não vejo uma “árvore”; vejo uma árvore agradável ou uma árvore feia. Não é possível abster-se dos pequenos valores que atribuímos às questões sem um esforço enorme e paralisante. Da mesma forma, não é possível manter uma situação em mente sem algum elemento de parcialidade. Algo em nossa querida natureza humana faz com que desejemos acreditar; e daí?

Lembre-se das discussões no Capítulo 14 sobre ligação preferencial e vantagem cumulativa. As duas teorias afirmam que vencer hoje faz com que seja mais provável que se vença no futuro. Portanto, as probabilidades dependem da história, e a primeira pressuposição que conduz à curva na forma de sino gaussiana fracassa na realidade. Nos jogos, obviamente, vitórias passadas não deveriam resultar em uma probabilidade aumentada de ganhos futuros — mas isso não acontece na vida real, motivo pelo qual me preocupo com o ensinamento de probabilidade através de jogos.

Permanence is incompatible with a predatory attitude which rejoices in the fact that 'what were luxuries for our fathers have become necessities for us', The cultivation and expansion of needs is the antithesis of wisdom. It is also the antithesis of freedom and peace, Every increase of needs tends to increase one's dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control, and therefore increases existential fear. Only by a reduction of needs can one promote a genuine reduction in those tensions which are the ultimate causes of strife and war. The economics of permanence implies a profound reorientation of science and technology, which have to open their doors to wisdom and, in fact, have to incorporate wisdom into their very structure.

They enable us to see the hollowness and fundamental unsatisfactoriness of a life devoted primarily to the pursuit of material ends, to the neglect of the spiritual. Such a life necessarily sets man against man and nation against nation, because man's needs are infinite and infinitude can be achieved only in the spiritual realm, never in the material. Man assuredly needs to rise above this humdrum 'world'; wisdom shows him the way to do it; without wisdom, he is driven to build up a monster economy, which destroys the world, and to seek fantastic satisfactions, like landing a man on the moon.

If they can do that, they have the future in their hands. If they cannot, they have nothing to offer that is worthy of the sweat of free-born men.

It means, first, that proprietary rights shall be maintained when they are accompanied by the performance of service and abolished when they are not. It means, second, that the producers shall stand in a direct relation to the community for whom production is carried on, so that their responsibility to it may be obvious and unmistakable, not lust, as at present, through their immediate subordination to shareholders whose interest is not service but gain. It means, in the third place, that the obligation for the maintenance of the service shall rest upon the professional organisations of those who perform it, and that, subject to the supervision and criticism of the consumer, those organisations shall exercise so much voice in the government of industry as may be needed to secure that the obligation is discharged,' Nineteen

Needless to say, wealth, education, research, and many other things are needed for any civilisation, but what is most needed today is a revision of the ends which these means are meant to serve.

International law will establish itself so much better than native law that the latter will no more have defenders. The national administrations which we were just describing take on in this perspective their true meaning: the States will be no more than administrative districts of a single Empire. And, from one end of the world to the other, in perfectly similar cities (since they will have been rebuilt after bombardments), there will live under similar laws a bastard population, a race of indefinable and gloomy slaves, without genius, without instinct, without voice. Dehydrated man will reign in a hygienic world. Immense bazaars echoing the sounds of record-players will symbolize this race of men of equal worth (à prix unique). Rolling sidewalks will run alongside the streets. They will transport every morning to their slave work the long line of the men without faces, and they will bring them back in the evening.

The first congress in Minsk is attended by just nine representatives of Marxist circles from different cities (even Struve himself is not there). All are arrested immediately. Struve’s virtual RSDLP is in fact the “grandmother” of the future Communist Party of the Soviet Union (in later Soviet textbooks Lenin is named as the founder of everything; Struve does not even get a mention).

That is the frame of mind in which the Russian Marxists gather for their first meeting, which they call the “second congress of the RSDLP,” a nod to the “first congress” six years earlier in Minsk, at which all nine participants were arrested. The Marxist congress in Brussels is attended by forty-three people. The chairman is, of course, Plekhanov. One of his deputies is the editor of Spark, real name Ulyanov, pen name Frey, but now going by his latest (and last) pseudonym, Lenin. The meeting immediately turns into a squabble, causing the Belgian authorities to politely ask the Russian revolutionaries to leave the country.

In 1889 Albert Victor, at Queen Victoria’s insistence, proposes to Alix. But soon afterwards the plan is derailed by scandal, and not just any scandal, but one that engulfs the British royal family. London police uncover a male brothel in Fitzrovia on Cleveland Street. At the time homosexuality is a criminal offence in Britain and its empire. An indirect victim is the writer Oscar Wilde, who alludes to the scandal in his 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. He will be imprisoned for “gross indecency” six years later.

The Union of Russian People was made up of Yablochkovs, all vaguely aware of the need to resist internationalist evil with a popular-national idea.” The Union of the Russian People is both anti-Marxist and anti-liberal. It professes populist ultra-nationalism, romanticizes violence, and rejects democratic values. In January-February 1905, when preparations begin for the elections to the State Duma, Dubrovin is single-minded: he refuses to recognize the validity of the exercise and declares that the Union of the Russian People will not participate.

The Bolsheviks’ second promise is to provide land for the peasants. However, they do the opposite: on 27 October the Congress of Soviets adopts the Decree on Land, abolishing the right of private land ownership entirely. At that time, a fifth of all land in Russia belongs to the peasants, but now the state takes it away from them and implements a redistribution and utilization program. But that is not all: less than six months later, in the spring of 1918, a “food dictatorship” decree is issued under which “committees of the poor” confiscate “surpluses” from the peasants, which amounts in practice to almost everything they produce.

At one of the villages, Wytschaete, there was hard fighting a day after the opening of the dikes. A unit of Bavarians had tried to take Wytschaete and failed, and in the aftermath of the attack a captain named Hoffman lay badly wounded between his troops and the French defenders. One of Hoffman’s men moved out of a protected position and, under enemy fire, picked him up and carried him to safety. The rescue accomplished nothing—the captain soon died of his wounds. But his rescuer would claim years later, in a notorious book, that his escape without a scratch was his first intimation that he was being spared for some great future. In the nearer term he was decorated for bravery. It was just a few days after Adolf Hitler’s exploit that Kaiser Wilhelm pinned the Iron Cross Second Class on his tunic.

Just as Ludendorff was ready to move, heavy snow began to fall. It fell for two days, accumulating to a depth of five feet as temperatures fell to forty degrees below zero. The Germans attacked anyway. Even more incredibly, they made good progress, taking the Russians by surprise and driving them out of their defenses. Again, winter gave the fighting a specially hellish quality, made all the worse by a sudden thaw that on February 14 turned ice to ice water and frozen earth to mud. Earlier the Germans had needed as many as eighteen horses to move each of their guns forward through the snow. Now, with the guns sinking into the ground, no number of horses could move them.

First it was noticed that the brass buttons on the soldiers’ uniforms had turned green. Someone deduced from this phenomenon that the mysterious cloud must be chlorine and knew of a quick preventive: by breathing through a cloth on which they had urinated (a spare sock, for example), the troops could neutralize the poison before it reached their lungs. The first improvised gas masks thus emerged almost immediately after the first use of chlorine.

A surgeon in a front-line post told me that, in a redoubt at the south part of the fort, of 200 French dead, fully half had more than two wounds. Those he was able to treat seemed utterly insane. They kept shouting war cries and their eyes blazed, and, strangest of all, they appeared indifferent to pain. At one moment anesthetics ran out owing to the impossibility of bringing forward fresh supplies through the bombardment. Arms, even legs, were amputated without a groan, and even afterward the men seemed not to have felt the shock. They asked for a cigarette or inquired how the battle was going.”

Fort Vaux, the all-but-final obstacle on the Germans’ long and bloody road down the east bank of the Meuse to Verdun, surrendered after days of bitter and brutal combat. Its defense had been so heroic that the French commander, who had given up at last only because his men were literally dying of thirst, was honored personally by the crown prince, who gave him a sword to replace one lost in the fight. The captive Major Raynal returned the favor by noting that young Wilhelm Hohenzollern was “not the monkey that our caricaturists have made him out to be.”

it was simply assumed, at every level of society, that Jews were not only different but different in ways that made them a problem. Germany was not the worst in this regard. That distinction belongs to Russia, which barred almost all Jews from citizenship, regarded its Jewish population as a threat to security, and continued to single the Jews out for atrocious mistreatment after the start of the war. France was not nearly that bad, Britain was a paragon of tolerance by comparison, but in every country to be a Jew was to be an alien to a greater or lesser extent.

Among his effects was a letter written days before his death. It was addressed to “the Russian people, to Papa [his name for the tsar], to the Russian Mother and to the Children, to the land of Russia.” In it he predicted that he would not live to see the new year, which was only days away when he wrote, and offered a warning. “Tsar of the land of Russia,” he wrote, “if you hear the sound of the bell which will tell you that Grigori has been killed, you must know this: if it was your relations who have wrought my death then no one of your family, that is to say none of your children or relations, will remain alive for more than two years. They will all be killed by the Russian people.”

Lloyd George was a believer in phrenology, the then-popular pseudoscientific discipline based on the idea that character and destiny are revealed in the shape of one’s head. He considered the contours of Nivelle’s head and saw victory there.

On the following day Lenin arrived in Petrograd from his long exile in Switzerland; Ludendorff, hoping to foment further disruption inside Russia, had approved his travel by rail from Switzerland via Frankfurt, Berlin, Stockholm, and Helsinki. Upon his arrival the Bolshevik leader began maneuvering his followers into an antiwar stance calculated to take advantage of public discontent.

In the near term Germany’s problems were almost trivial when compared with those facing the French in the aftermath of the Nivelle offensive. The French army, or a dangerously big part of it, was in open rebellion, refusing to obey orders, assaulting and even killing officers, deserting. Troops were crowding into Paris in a state of extreme disorder. French archives on the mutiny have been sealed since the war and will remain so until 2017, but enough is known to make clear that at its peak it was a threat to the survival of the republic. Within six weeks of its start half of the French divisions on the Western Front were rendered nonfunctional as a result of what one officer called “a sort of moral nihilism, an army without faith.” The government, more euphemistically, described the problem as “collective indiscipline.”

Ludendorff was aggressive as always, urging not only that Estonia, Livonia, Finland, and Ukraine should be taken from Russia but that the German army should continue driving eastward until they had overthrown the Bolsheviks. The kaiser went even further. He proposed breaking what had been the Romanov empire into four separate entities: a truncated Russia proper, Ukraine, Siberia, and a Union of the South East. Such skeptics as Hoffmann, Kühlmann, and Hertling were not only powerless but by now essentially voiceless. The Russians were shocked by what was demanded of them in the aftermath of this meeting. Trotsky threw up his hands, telling the Germans that he would never agree to what they wanted and urging Lenin to adopt a “no war, no peace” policy in which Russia would neither continue to fight nor agree to Germany’s terms. When the negotiations broke down completely, the Germans swiftly put fifty divisions back into motion along the Eastern Front. The Russians were so helpless that the Germans, though their best men and equipment were now in France, advanced a hundred and fifty miles in five days. The Turks, also unimpeded, advanced through the Caucasus to oil-rich Baku in Azerbaijan. The Ukrainian capital of Kiev fell to the Germans on March 1. Trotsky, furious, said that Russia should rejoin the Entente and resume the war. Lenin, fearing the capture of Petrograd and the destruction of his fledgling regime, moved his government to Moscow and said no. On March 3 the Russian delegation, with Trotsky no longer participating, signed at Brest-Litovsk one of the most punitive peace treaties in history. Russia

By midday they had advanced five miles and (the British and French having failed to destroy the bridges) were across the Aisne. Corporal Adolf Hitler, armed only with a pistol and operating alone, captured twelve French soldiers during the advance. For this action he was given an Iron Cross First Class, complementing the Iron Cross Second Class he had received almost four years earlier.

To the south, Britain and France came into conflict over how to divide their Middle Eastern spoils. Britain took Palestine, opening it to emigration by European Jews under the Balfour Declaration. After suppressing a rebellion in Mesopotamia, it threw Kurdish, Sunni, and Shia populations together in a new puppet kingdom called Iraq. France was allowed to have Lebanon and, despite deep reluctance on Britain’s part, Syria.

Though Hitler reiterated in his monologue that winter evening that to him Tristan und Isolde was “Wagner’s masterpiece,” it is the stupendous Nibelungen Ring, a series of four operas which was inspired by the great German epic myth, Nibelungenlied, and on which the composer worked for the better part of twenty-five years, that gave Germany and especially the Third Reich so much of its primitive Germanic mythos. Often a people’s myths are the highest and truest expression of its spirit and culture, and nowhere is this more true than in Germany. Schelling even argued that “a nation comes into existence with its mythology … The unity of its thinking, which means a collective philosophy, [is] presented in its mythology; therefore its mythology contains the fate of the nation.” And Max Mell, a contemporary poet, who wrote a modern version of the Song of the Nibelungs, declared, “Today only little has remained of the Greek gods that humanism wanted to implant so deeply into our culture … But Siegfried and Kriemhild were always in the people’s soul!”

The great benefit of the Enlightenment has been to bring the individual to the fore, with his rights, his freedom, his independence, his “pursuit of happiness” (whatever that “happiness” means), and, most of all, his privacy. In spite of its denial of antifragility, the Enlightenment and the political systems that emerged from it freed us (somewhat) from the domination of society, the tribe, and the family that had prevailed throughout history. The unit in traditional cultures is the collective; and it could be perceived to be harmed by the behavior of an individual—the honor of the family is sullied when, say, a daughter becomes pregnant, or a member of the family engages in large-scale financial swindles and Ponzi schemes, or, worst, may even teach a college course in the charlatanic subject of financial economics.

My definition of modernity is humans’ large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world’s jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors. Modernity corresponds to the systematic extraction of humans from their randomness-laden ecology—physical and social, even epistemological. Modernity is not just the postmedieval, postagrarian, and postfeudal historical period as defined in sociology textbooks. It is rather the spirit of an age marked by rationalization (naive rationalism), the idea that society is understandable, hence must be designed, by humans. With it was born statistical theory, hence the beastly bell curve. So was linear science. So was the notion of “efficiency”—or optimization.

When you become rich, the pain of losing your fortune exceeds the emotional gain of getting additional wealth, so you start living under continuous emotional threat. A rich person becomes trapped by belongings that take control of him, degrading his sleep at night, raising the serum concentration of his stress hormones, diminishing his sense of humor, perhaps even causing hair to grow on the tip of his nose and similar ailments. Seneca fathomed that possessions make us worry about downside, thus acting as a punishment as we depend on them. All upside, no downside. Even more: dependence on circumstances—rather, the emotions that arise from circumstances—induces a form of slavery.

The young in the Third Reich were growing up to have strong and healthy bodies, faith in the future of their country and in themselves and a sense of fellowship and camaraderie that shattered all class and economic and social barriers. I thought of that later, in the May days of 1940, when along the road between Aachen and Brussels one saw the contrast between the German soldiers, bronzed and clean-cut from a youth spent in the sunshine on an adequate diet, and the first British war prisoners, with their hollow chests, round shoulders, pasty complexions and bad teeth—tragic examples of the youth that England had neglected so irresponsibly in the years between the wars.

Medical researchers call such lag the “translational gap,” the time difference between formal discovery and first implementation, which, if anything, owing to excessive noise and academic interests, has been shown by Contopoulos-Ioannidis and her peers to be lengthening in modern times. The historian David Wooton relates a gap of two centuries between the discovery of germs and the acceptance of germs as a cause of disease, a delay of thirty years between the germ theory of putrefaction and the development of antisepsis, and a delay of sixty years between antisepsis and drug therapy.

It is sad, certainly, to have to count our victims: 77 in Ascq, 120 in Tulle, 800 in Oradour, and to have to cite 6 villages burned in France, 12 in the Belgian Ardennes. But, even with these facts, one does not speak of a will to exterminate, when a Soviet prosecutor can rise and cite 135,000 shot in the area of Smolensk, 172,000 in the area of Leningrad, 195,000 in Karkhov, 100,000 in Babi-Yar, close to Kiev, and affirm that the German army destroyed 70,000 villages.

Under the pretext of attacking an authoritative regime, one has destroyed authority everywhere, and under the pretext of condemning Germany, one has shackled everyone. We have let ourselves act in the name of virtue and a better world, without seeing that this Super-State which prohibits by principle certain forms of State, which dictates the contracts and which [233] supervises the policies, is nothing other than an anonymous suzerain who regulates the condition of his vassals. International morality is only the instrument of a reign.

We will not hold against the representatives of the universal conscience their impotence to ensure respect for human dignity, even in the territories controlled by it. That would be [237] too easy a game. There are obviously all kinds of people who, at present, cannot claim to pass for human persons: for example, the Indochinese whom we massacre in Indo-China, the Madagascans whom we imprison in Madagascar, the Baltic peoples, the Sudetens, the Germans of the Volga who make great tourists in the centers of D.P.,[83] the little Nazis, the average Nazis and other monsters whom one is obliged to lock up in Dachau and Mauthausen, the Poles and the Czechs who do not like the Soviet government, the Negroes of Louisiana and the Carolinas, the French who shouted: “Long live the Marshal,” the Arabs who shouted: “Long live the Sultan,” the Greeks who shouted: “Long live Greece,” and the Ukrainians whom one sends to Siberia because they have the misfortune of being surviving Ukrainians… I allow that all that does not prove anything, though I find this list a little long.

Low Back Disorders, 3E (McGill, Stuart M.)
- Your Highlight on page 24 | Location 831-840 | Added on Tuesday, December 8, 2020 11:41:34 PM

Is specific exercise needed or manual tissue work, or perhaps both? Are the pain and symptoms from a single source or multiple sources? Are the radiating symptoms neural in origin (and if so, what is causing the nerve tension or compression), or are they ischemic? Is the pain organic to a tissue or a neural representation of pain similar to phantom limb pain (which I am convinced explains some of the myalgic syndromes)? These are just a few situations that are not dismissed by the excellent clinician. Worse yet are clinicians who fail to address the cause of the pain and then default to blame the patient for having a psychosocial disorder. I close with one further generalization. A clinician who provides only passive treatments to a patient has little evidence documenting that the patient will have fewer symptoms in the future. For example, the clinician may perform an injection into the back (no supporting evidence for reducing back pain; Staal et al., 2009), manipulate some joints in the spine, or stretch the patient on a machine. Passive treatments may be helpful at the beginning of a larger treatment plan for certain people. In this case, the patient is progressed quickly into an active approach. The evidence does support the importance of the patients’ being fully invested in understanding the cause of pain and practicing strategies throughout the day to avoid these pain triggers.

In practice I see the people who are worse off because of surgery; surgeons refer to them as failed backs (note: I do not see the surgical successes). I strongly suspect that many had the surgery too soon. They thought they had exhausted conservative approaches, but a review of their files revealed that they had received inappropriate treatment. The therapeutic exercises prescribed to them were not matched to their specific pain mechanisms and caused more pain. They were not shown the specific causes of their pain, so they failed in preventing pain. Or their surgeon's declaration that they "failed conservative care” simply meant that a specific amount of time had passed.

Follow-up of postsurgical people compared with nonsurgical people can be sobering. Nguyen and colleagues (2011) followed up a historical group of compensated back-injured workers over the 3-year period from 1999 to 2001. A total of 725 had had lumbar fusion, compared with 725 nonsurgical control back-injured workers. After 2 years, 67% of nonsurgical people had returned to work compared with 26% of those who had had surgery. Reoperations were conducted on 27% of the surgical cases, and 36% reported complications and higher long-term opioid use. Permanent disability occurred in 11% of postsurgical patients and 2% of nonsurgical patients. The notion that surgery will eliminate back pain does not have statistical support. People have to manage their postsurgical backs just as much as they would their nonsurgical backs.

Encumbered markets are the norm in every society, whereas free markets are a product of artifice, design and political coercion. Laissez-faire must be centrally planned; regulated markets just happen. The free market is not, as New Right thinkers have imagined or claimed, a gift of social evolution. It is an end-product of social engineering and unyielding political will.

Few visions of the future have ever been so delusive as Herbert Marcuse’s or Michel Foucault’s perennially fashionable vision of perfected capitalist control of society. Late modern capitalism may incarcerate people in high-tech prisons and monitor them by video surveillance cameras at their work-place and in the high street; but it does not box them into an iron cage of bureaucracy or imprison them forever within a minute niche in the division of labour. It abandons them to a life of fragments and a proliferation of senseless choices. The dystopia we face is not a nightmare of totalitarian control. Intermingling the ephemera of fashion with an ingrained reflex of nihilism, American Psycho is a truer approximation to the late modern condition than Kafka’s The Castle. Free markets are the most potent solvents of tradition at work in the world today. They set a premium on novelty and a discount on the past. They make of the future an infinite rerun of the present. The society they engender is antinomian and proletarian.

The result is a re-proletarianization of much of the industrial working class and the de-bourgeoisification of what remains of the former middle classes. The free market seems set to achieve what socialism was never able to accomplish – a euthanasia of bourgeois life. The imperatives of flexibility and mobility imposed by deregulated labour markets put particular strain on traditional modes of family life. How can families meet for meals when both parents work on shifts? What becomes of families when the job market pulls parents apart?

Like the Utopia envisaged by Lenin, the global free market aims to bring into being a state of affairs that has never hitherto existed in human society – and which goes far beyond the mid-Victorian English free market and the liberal international economic order that existed until 1914. In a global free market the movements of goods, services and capital are unfettered by political controls imposed by any sovereign state, and markets have been detached from their original societies and cultures. This is a Utopia divorced from history, hostile to vital human needs, and finally as self-destroying as any that has been attempted in our century.

The connective tissues of social life have renewed themselves in Russia to a surprising degree. The extended family, which has all but ceased to exist in the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, has survived Soviet communism in Russia.85 Its survival partly accounts for the ability of Russians to cope with the hardships of market reform. As Layard and Parker observe: ‘Two institutions have been crucial to survival: the extended family and the private plot of land. The extended family … is a strong element in the system of social security. Adult children almost always help their parents in old age, and people also help their siblings if they are in trouble.’86 It is the comparative weakness of ‘individualism’ in Russia that has allowed mutual aid in the extended family to persist to a degree unknown in many western, and particularly Anglo-Saxon, societies.

Tais espetáculos apresentam-se aos olhos de muitos como o mais alto estágio da grandeza humana. São elogiados como manifestações de “consciência social”, da “vontade popular”, etc. Nada há aí de grandioso. Não que os homens não possam unir-se para manifestar o que desejam, o que temem, o que querem. Para isso há meios vários, cultos, ordenados, superiores para propagar o seu querer, o seu pensar e o seu desejo.

porque ao se desligar, como se fez, o cientista da filosofia perene,[24] o sábio, graças a esse desvinculamento, pensando que filosofia é essa mixórdia que se apresenta por aí, despreza-a totalmente e, entregue apenas à aridez da sua especialidade, desligado da universalidade, poderá tornar-se um monstro que vê tudo segundo a cor da sua proveta, e dentro do campo estreito que lhe permite ver a sua viseira. E então será ele um candidato nato ao barbarismo. Imaginai todo o poder da ciência e da técnica atual em mãos de bárbaros. Não é preciso muito esforço para conceber o que de terrível se passaria sobre o mundo. Não é exigível uma imaginação fértil demais para conceber o que seria de nós se dependêssemos de meros especialistas, que nada entendem do que estiver fora da sua especialidade e que nem sequer conhecem os princípios da sua especialidade, pois só a filosofia pode tratar desses princípios e, por isso mesmo, nem a sua especialidade conhecem bem. Todos esses seres, estranhos e desconhecidos, ignotos, incomunicáveis uns aos outros, servindo a algum césar que deles surja, e que será forçosamente bárbaro, nos transformariam em cobaias, em tubos de experiência, em coisas numeradas e protocoladas. Que mundo terrível esse! E esse mundo vem aí, senhores, esse mundo se aproxima a passos de gigante. Não é para séculos, é para decênios. E tudo isso não se soube evitar. Nada se fez de útil para humanizar esses sábios, que pouco ou nada têm de sabedoria, porque esta é uma virtude prática, que nos liga às virtudes dianoéticas, mas que tem como objeto o conhecimento dos primeiros princípios.

The Great Leap Forward was not just an attempt to industrialize Chinese agriculture and collectivize industry on a Soviet model. It was also a systematic attack on traditional Chinese practices and beliefs. Peasant traditional beliefs had been under siege since the communist victory in 1949, but it was in the Great Leap Forward, and then the Cultural Revolution, that they were finally almost destroyed: ‘Everything connected with traditional beliefs was smashed up in the Great Leap Forward.’

Will the resources of critical rationality which we have inherited from the Enlightenment enable us to cope with the disorders that its most recent project has created or compounded? Or is the global anarchy in which we find ourselves an historical fate against which we are bound to struggle, but which we are powerless to overcome? It will surely be one of history’s darkest ironies if the Enlightenment project of a world civilization ends in a chaos of sovereign states and stateless peoples struggling for the necessities of survival. The spread of new technologies throughout the world is not working to advance human freedom. Instead it has resulted in the emancipation of market forces from social and political control. By allowing that freedom to world markets we ensure that the age of globalization will be remembered as another turn in the history of servitude.

Of course it was the idea that global economic collapse could no longer happen that was truly apocalyptic. History does not stop. It continues, as evolving technologies interact with the unalterable human animal and old conflicts are given new twists. Governments may be better informed than they have ever been, but they are not any wiser and if politicians and their advisers believed the boom could go on for ever it was because they had lost any sense of history. Capitalism may be the most productive economic system that has so far developed but it has always been highly volatile. The idea that once released from government regulation the market would be self-stabilizing can only be explained in the context of the absurdly unrealistic world-view that prevailed in the twenty years after the collapse of communism.

Beginning after the Second World War, the change in economics did not immediately have much practical effect. Post-war economists may have expected too much from macroeconomic modelling; but so long as they were disciples of Keynes they understood that no calculus of probability could map the future. Only when the fundamentalist dogmas of free-market ideology melded with positivist methodology in the Chicago School was this insight lost. The result was faith-based economics, masquerading as science.

while peak oil may have already arrived. Depleting the earth of its remaining reserves of cheap conventional oil, then moving on to coal, will speed up global warming; but because of the lack of any overall alternative it is probably inevitable. Renewable energy cannot support a world of nine billion humans – the consensus estimate of the global population forty years from now. There is no Green energy mix that can sustain industrialization in a world of high and rising human numbers. The result can only be intensified conflict. Humans have already exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet, and as climate change advances the overshoot will become more extreme.

Faster climate change will itself foment conflict by triggering population movements and a scramble for oil and minerals as global warming uncovers the polar caps.

In these circumstances the task for humankind is not to promote sustainable development. It is to work out how to make a sustainable retreat,7 and here technology will be crucial. There are many ills that technology cannot cure – it cannot reverse the destruction of biosphere or make humans more reasonable, for example. There is no technical fix for the planet, or for the human condition. Even so, hightech solutions – including technologies that most Greens most oppose, such as nuclear power, genetically modified food and cleaner coal – will be indispensable in negotiating the environmental chaos that is now unavoidable. The goal must be to reduce not the carbon footprint but the human impact on the planet, the ultimate cause of the climate shift that is under way today. This cannot be done by reverting to modes of life that seem more natural. At best, the result of Green policies of this kind would be a crowded and conquered Earth in which every available spot was turned over to organic farms and wind turbines. Happily this is a nightmare that has no chance of becoming reality.

The meltdown of financial markets has done more than wipe out wealth on an unprecedented scale. It has also destroyed the neo-liberal belief in progress through ever expanding production and consumption, and an anxious search is under way for a replacement creed. Religious fundamentalism is one result of this quest, Green utopianism another. Intelligent improvisation – using technical fixes to reduce the human impact on the Earth, for example – is more likely to yield results than the search for solutions. But realistic thinking goes against the grain. It is easier to inhabit an imaginary future than deal with the intractable present. The boom years were based on the belief that if we all ran faster the past could be left behind. Instead we had the crash, history moved on and it is the future that has been consumed.

False Dawn’s reception confirmed one of its central theses: contemporary opinion – in politics, the media and business – has become so detached from enduring human realities that it can no longer distinguish utopia from reality. As a result, it is unprepared for the return of history – with its familiar intractable conflicts, tragic choices and ruined illusions – which we are currently witnessing.

Conventional opinion perceives the collapse of communism as a victory for ‘the West’. In fact, Marxian socialism was a prototypically western ideology. Over the long haul of history, the disintegration of Marxian socialism in Russia and China represents a defeat for all western models of modernization. The breakdown of central planning in the Soviet Union and its dismantlement in China marked the end of an experiment in forced-march modernization in which the model of modernity was the nineteenth century capitalist factory.

A global free market is a project that was destined to fail. In this, as in much else, it resembles that other twentieth century experiment in utopian social engineering, Marxian socalism. Each was convinced that human progress must have a single civilization as its goal. Each denied that a modern economy can come in many varieties. Each was ready to exact a large price in suffering from humanity in order to impose its single vision on the world. Each has run aground on vital human needs. If we take history as our guide, we must expect that the global free market will shortly belong to an irrecoverable past. Like other twentieth-century utopias, global laissez-faire – together with its casualties – will be swallowed into the memory hole of history.

Qualquer homem sabe que a mulher que balançava seu berço tinha um poder enorme sobre ele, e a mulher que abria as pernas para ele tinha poder ainda maior. E a que colocava seu sexo na boca detinha sua vida entre sua língua e seus dentes. Para o bem e para o mal. Mas hoje, como o sexo perdeu o lugar para o “gênero” – uma invenção de gente que não transita pelo desejo pelo outro sexo – o mundo do desejo entre homens e mulheres está em extinção. Toda doença maligna se mostra primeiro no espírito e depois no corpo. Agora pais são sempre relatados como idiotas e mães como sábias absolutas, para acompanhar os filmes românticos em que homens são sempre mentirosos contumazes e mulheres são seres em busca de uma verdade pura em seus relacionamentos.

Thus free trade causes the impoverishment and immiseration of the labor force, and a cascading series of economic busts driven by the mismatch between insufficent consumption and excess investment. Those problems aren’t accidental—they’re hardwired into any free trade system—and the only way to stop them in their tracks is to abandon free trade as bad policy, and replace it with sensible trade barriers that ensure that most of the products consumed in each nation are made there.

this book is an inquiry into and a lamentation about the most significant American cultural fact of the second half of the twentieth century: the decline of the Age of Typography and the ascendancy of the Age of Television. This change-over has dramatically and irreversibly shifted the content and meaning of public discourse, since two media so vastly different cannot accommodate the same ideas.

Thus, we have here a great loop of impotence: The news elicits from you a variety of opinions about which you can do nothing except to offer them as more news, about which you can do nothing. Prior to the age of telegraphy, the information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives. What people knew about had action-value. In the information world created by telegraphy, this sense of potency was lost, precisely because the whole world became the context for news.

It may be of some interest to note, in this connection, that the crossword puzzle became a popular form of diversion in America at just that point when the telegraph and the photograph had achieved the transformation of news from functional information to decontextualized fact. This coincidence suggests that the new technologies had turned the age-old problem of information on its head: Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context; the cocktail party is another; the radio quiz shows of the 1930’s and 1940’s and the modern television game show are still others; and the ultimate, perhaps, is the wildly successful “Trivial Pursuit.” In one form or another, each of these supplies an answer to the question, “What am I to do with all these disconnected facts?” And in one form or another, the, answer is the same: Why not use them for diversion? for entertainment? to amuse yourself, in a game?

The fight against censorship is a nineteenth-century issue which was largely won in the twentieth. What we are confronted with now is the problem posed by the economic and symbolic structure of television. Those who run television do not limit our access to information but in fact widen it. Our Ministry of Culture is Huxleyan, not Orwellian. It does everything possible to encourage us to watch continuously. But what we watch is a medium which presents information in a form that renders it simplistic, nonsubstantive, nonhistorical and noncontextual; that is to say, information packaged as entertainment. In America, we are never denied the opportunity to amuse ourselves.

In other words, the most important thing one learns is always something about how one learns. As Dewey wrote in another place, we learn what we do. Television educates by teaching children to do what television-viewing requires of them. And that is as precisely remote from what a classroom requires of them as reading a book is from watching a stage show.

For example, it would have been excusable in 1905 for us to be unprepared for the cultural changes the automobile would bring. Who could have suspected then that the automobile would tell us how we were to conduct our social and sexual lives? Would reorient our ideas about what to do with our forests and cities? Would create new ways of expressing our personal identity and social standing? But it is much later in the game now, and ignorance of the score is inexcusable. To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple. Moreover, we have seen enough by now to know that technological changes in our modes of communication are even more ideology-laden than changes in our modes of transportation. Introduce the alphabet to a culture and you change its cognitive habits, its social relations, its notions of community, history and religion. Introduce the printing press with movable type, and you do the same. Introduce speed-of-light transmission of images and you make a cultural revolution. Without a vote. Without polemics. Without guerrilla resistance. Here is ideology, pure if not serene. Here is ideology without words, and all the more powerful for their absence. All that is required to make it stick is a population that devoutly believes in the inevitability of progress. And in this sense, all Americans are Marxists, for we believe nothing if not that history is moving us toward some preordained paradise and that technology is the force behind that movement.

It’s not terribly politically correct to frame a male-led household as better than a female-led one and there are obvious concerns about how this can be abused by the husband. However, these are essentially no different than the same concerns of a relationship where a female is dominant over the male. I’m sure the reader knows of several men living in a state of constant fear for displeasing their wives and the resultant tongue-lashing that would follow. Not to mention how studies show that women are no less prone to resort to violence than men are in relationships. Leadership and husbandly dominance ideally works on the principle of evoking the desire to follow. If a wife submits, it’s through her own consent and right to do so. For the majority of wives, a husband acting with leadership creates and sustains her sexual attraction to him, which is of ultimate benefit to both of them in the relationship. Likewise, the ability to exercise reasonable discipline and direction over the children in the family frames a husband as the social leader and makes him more attractive to his wife. A husband’s failure to be effective with the children will reduce the wife’s attraction to him.

This physical connection is also good for babies and children. There is the well-known effect of “failure to thrive” in babies that are supplied with adequate food and shelter, but are left untouched. Without physical touch, the babies suffer slower growth, greater illness and can even die.

Medical issues aside, when you are cut off from sex by your spouse, the marriage is in critical condition because one spouse has started actively working against the marriage. This is a serious and legitimate issue. You have the right to feel angry and hurt by it. It’s okay to take action to address this issue.

The solution is to take action that makes it clear that the problem is in fact intolerable. While you don't know whether you will make a move towards option two (extramarital sex), or option three (divorce), option one just isn't acceptable anymore. You need to stop pursuing the dead end of sex with your wife and start preparing yourself to pursue things with other women in general. So you work out, upgrade the clothes a little, open up a dating profile, just go "out" a little without providing the details, smile, be happy, friendly, carefree, text some new friends, socialize...

The goal is to stop chasing and pursuing your wife and generally make it clear by your actions that you are no longer going to be held as her emotional hostage. Show that you will be capable of moving towards a life without her and that you have discovered the will to do so. Once you have that attitude down, there is a reasonable chance that her level of interest in you will significantly change for the better. Don’t actually cheat on her; just make it clear you have the potential to move on without her. This sounds like a dangerous anti-marriage ploy, but I figure after a marriage has been sexually dead for no good reason for a year or more, it's essentially over and you're justified in taking such bold steps. Stop

The Betaization Trap is that by trying to do everything possible to make her happy and being endlessly nice to her, you undo what created her initial attraction to you, so she falls out of love and loses sexual interest. Most men never understand this until it is too late

Don’t become angry, frustrated, insulting, bad tempered, grumpy, sullen or otherwise freeze her out. All that drama will just underline that she has power over you to affect you by denying you sex. By having an emotional reaction about not getting sex, you are making it clear to her that she has enormous leverage over you by giving or not giving you sex.

Over the long term though, constant denial does very much become a hot issue and outside the bedroom, it should be something that is mentioned only occasionally. Again, work hard to not frame it in anger or that she is trying to do something wrong; frustration and disappointment is a better angle. Long term though, (as in over months and years) you gain the most leverage by self-improvement rather than complaint.
