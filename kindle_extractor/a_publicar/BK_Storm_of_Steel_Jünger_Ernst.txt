There was a lot of activity in the field altogether in those days, some of it not without its funny - or bloody funny - side. For instance, a soldier on one of our patrols was shot at because he had a stammer and couldn't get the password out in time.

One morning, as I lay half asleep in bed, a comrade came in to escort me to duty. We were chatting, and he was toying with my pistol, which as usual was on my bedside table, when he fired a shot that narrowly missed my skull. I have witnessed several fatal accidents in war that were caused by careless handling of weapons; cases like that are always especially irritating.
